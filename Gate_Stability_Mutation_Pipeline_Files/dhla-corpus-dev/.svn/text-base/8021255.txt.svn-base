The primers used for sequencing are as follows (listed from 3' to 5' with the starting nucleotide number (4) given and c and n indicating coding and non-coding strand, respectively): 999 ATGATAAATGCAATTCGC (c), 1303ACCGCAACTTCCTGCTTGC (c), 1590 CTGACCGAAGCTGAGGCC (c), 1928TTCTGTCTCGGCAAAGTG (n), 1628GAAAGGCGCAGCATACGC (n)?1322TGCAAGCAGGAAGTTGCG (n). Purification of Haloalkane Dehalogenase-Mutants of Pseudomonas GJ31(pPJ20) were grown at 30 "C in a mineral medium (1) containing 4m M 1-chlorohexane asthe sole carbon source. After 4 days, cells were M Tris.H,SO, buffer, pH harvested by centrifugation, washed in 10 m M p-mercaptoethanol, and sonicated 7.5, containing 1 rn EDTA and 1m after resuspension in this buffer. Mutant haloalkane dehalogenases were purified as described before (1). Determination of Dehalogenase Activities-The activities of the mutant enzymes weretested with a variety of substrates by spectrophotometric measurementof the rates of halide production (1)using purified enzymes (wild type and mutants P168S, A164-174, and V152-153) or crude extracts (mutants D170H, V172-174, and V145-154). The concentration of 1-chlorohexane in the assays was 3 mM, the other substrates were used at 5 r n . The dehalogenase content of cell-free extracts wasdetermined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the protein bands of SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and subsequent peak inteMutation scanner. Accuracy gration of scans of the gels wastaken witha desktop was better than 10%. For the determinationof&, V , and k,JKm, alcohol production was measured in 4.5-ml incubations containing 0.014 m M substrate in 50 m M Tris.H,SO, buffer, pH 8.2, and 10 milliunits of l,2-dibromoethane dehalogenase or100 milliunits of I-chlorohexane or 1,2-dichloroethane dehalogenase. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 30 "C, and the amount of alcohol produced was determined ona Chrompack 438s gas chromatograph witha CPWax 52 CB column, usingan ECD detector for 2-bromoethanol and a FID detector for 2-chloroethanol and I-hexanol. The carrier gas was nitrogen (60 kPa), and the temperature program was 3-min isothermal at 45"Cfollowed by an increase to200"C at 10 "C/min. K, and V , , values were calculated from the rates of alcohol production by nonlinear regression analysis usingthe Michaelis-Menten equation and the Enzfitter program of Leatherbarrow (21).

FIG. 2. Repeats and mutations in the dhZA gene. The part of the gene that encodes the N-terminal region of the cap domain is shown, together with the amino acid sequence.Residues forming the active site cavity are encircled. The boxes above the protein sequence indicate the position of strand 6 of the f3-sheet and a-helices 4 and 5. The large solid arrowsmark the 15-bp direct repeat. One copy ofthe repeatwith flanking nucleotides is deleted in the 8164-174 mutant enzymes (dashed box), the formation of which is explained by misalignment of the 9-bp imperfect direct repeat at theends of the deleted sequence (open arrows).Of this 9-bp repeat, the right-hand copy is again duplicated in mutant V172-174 (closed box). The other repeats detected in the mutants arelocated in the N-terminal part of the sequence encodingthe cap domain (closed boxes).The bases printed in bold characters mark the position of the mutations in D170H and P168S, causing the substitutions indicated.

intermediate. How 1-chlorohexane is bound is unknown, but a larger or more flexible hydrophobic cavity that increases the binding energy of the larger substrate is likely. The wild type enzyme also must have considerable flexibility to allow substrate binding, since the active site cavity ( 5 6 ) is too small for binding 1-bromohexane, which is a substrate for wild type haloalkane dehalogenase. Furthermore, the cavity is buried which requires some cap domain residues to move for substrate entrance. Large substrate-induced structural changes are observed in themobile surface loops of lipase of Rhizomucor miehei (26), human pancreatic lipase (271, and lipoprotein lipase (28, 291, which are also oJP-hydrolase fold excursions (7). Mechanism of in Vivo Mutagenesis-Of the six mutations found, only two appeared to be substitutions. The high frequency with which the 11-amino acid deletion mutant was found (6 out of 12 mutants) can be explained by a strand slippage mechanism involving the 9-bp imperfect repeat that flanksin the wild type sequencethe segment that deleted is in theA164174 mutant. This can be followed by excision during mismatch repair or replication (Figs. 2 and 5 ) . Such a process has been FIG. 3.

FIG. 5. Proposed modelsfor the formationof the A164174 deletion during replication. Replication of the plasmid and transcription of dhlA are in the same direction (4, 34). The two direct repeats which are present in wild type dhlA are indicated by lines. The broken line indicates the 9-bp imperfect repeat that can be involved in strand slippage. A loop of DNA is excised and a g (bold) is mismatch repaired to c. The result is a deletion of 33 bases. In A, leading strand synthesis during replication is indicated by the arrow. Mismatch repair occurs only in the template strand. In B, the arrow indicates lagging strand synthesis, and repair must occur in both strands. The slipped DNA is shown in italics.





process similar to the selection of the mutations that arose during cultivation on 1-chlorohexane,with a few additional fine tuning modifications leading to the present wild type DhlA. Thus, we hypothesize that the direct repeats in the DNA sequence encoding the N-terminal part of the cap domain are of recent evolutionary origin and were selected during the adaptation of an older dehalogating enzyme to industrially produced 1,2-dichloroethane.
