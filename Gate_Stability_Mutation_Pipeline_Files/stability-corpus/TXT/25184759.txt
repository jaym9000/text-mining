ABSTRACT: Using alternate measures of fold stability for a
wide variety of Trp-cage mutants has raised the possibility that
prior dynamics T-jump measures may not be reporting on
complete cage formation for some species. NMR relaxation
studies using probes that only achieve large chemical shift
difference from unfolded values on complete cage formation
indicate slower folding in some but not all cases. Fourteen
species have been examined, with cage formation time
constants (1/kF) ranging from 0.9−7.5 μs at 300 K. The
present study does not change the status of the Trp-cage as a
fast folding, essentially two-state system, although it does alter
the stage at which this description applies. A diversity of
prestructuring events, depending on the specific analogue examined, may appear in the folding scenario, but in all cases,
formation of the N-terminal helix is complete either at or before the cage-formation transition state. In contrast, the fold-
stabilizing H-bonding interactions of the buried Ser14 side chain and the Arg/Asp salt bridge are post-transition state features on
the folding pathway. The study has also found instances in which a [P12W] mutation is fold destabilizing but still serves to
accelerate the folding process.
The Trp-cage has become a protein folding paradigm andthe preferred test system for molecular dynamics (MD)
based folding studies and fold prediction algorithms.1,2 The two
features that led to this status are its small size and fast folding
rates. A wide variety of folding pathways have been proposed
based on these computational studies, and quite different
conclusions have been reached concerning the extent to which
this model protein should be viewed as an unfolded ensemble
proceeding to a fully folded state with no detectable
intermediates. Turning to the experimental data, the fast
folding of the Trp-cage (the original TC5b construct, NLYIQ
WLKDG GPSSG RPPPS, Tm = 42 °C) was noted in the very
first report on the fold,3 there given as 1/kF = 7 ± 2 μs at 40 °C
based on both NMR exchange broadening and IR-monitored
T-jump experiments. The NMR experiment employed a G11α
resonance which has a 3.5 ppm upfield ring current shift as the
probe. The T-jump experiment followed the decrease in the
“solvated” helical amide I′ band (1628 cm−1) amplitude after a
10 °C T-jump which fit to a single exponential.
With the 2002 publication of the details regarding the
characterization of TC5b,4 the system attracted the attention of
other biophysicists. Because of the extreme quenching of Trp
fluorescence associated with the folded state,5 fluorescence-
monitored T-jump experiments were another possibility. Qiu et
al.6 reported 1/kF = 4.1 μs at 23.5 °C with the published data
graph indicating a folding time constant of 3.56 μs at 300 K. In
2011, the Gai lab7 reported essentially the same value in T-
jump experiments monitoring the helical amide band
(specifically at 1630 cm−1), 1/kF = 3.7 μs at 25 °C.
Culik et al.7 also reported dynamics data for TC10b, a
sequence (DAYAQ WLKDG GPSSG RPPPS, Tm = 56 °C
8 that
forms a more stable Trp-cage fold largely due to the enhanced
intrinsic helicity9 of the residue Asp1−Lys8 span. Culik et al.
employed the DA*YA*QW··· sequence with A* = 13C′-Ala and
observed peaks at 1586, 1615, and 1646 (all with decreasing
absorbance on warming) and 1664−1672 cm−1 (increasing
absorbance on warming) in the temperature-differenced FT-IR
spectra. These were attributed to 1586 (the Asp-CO2
− signal in
the salt bridge), 1615 (helical A*), 1646 (a shifted unlabeled
helical amide band, shifted due to an overlapping nonhelical A*
peak), and 1664 cm−1 (a 310 helix signal and an increasing
random coil signal). These assignments may not be correct.
The effect of 13CO labeling is expected to be a 36 cm−1
frequency shift versus 12CO and has been measured10 at 39
cm−1 in model helices. There was a distinct maximum at 1630
cm−1 separating the 1615 and 1646 minima in the FT-IR
difference spectra reported by Culik et al.7 We would attribute
the 1630 maximum to increases in random coil A* and would
expect the negative peak at 1586 to contain a significant
component of helical-A* melting. Gai and co-workers

monitored relaxation after the T-jumps at 1580, 1612, and 1664
cm−1. At 1664 cm−1, the data were biexponential with the
following time constants at 292 K, τ = 300 ns (attributed to
local unfolding of the 310 helix) and τ = 2.5 μs (growth of
unlabeled random coil 12CO). The slow phase was attributed
to global unfolding and gave the same time constants observed
as when monitoring at 1580 or 1612 cm−1: 1/kF = 1.55 μs at 25
°C.
Pertinent to the present study, the Feng Gai group has also
measured the effects of a number of mutations on folding
dynamics. These included the Gly10 to D-Ala mutation which
we reported in 200811 as a strategy for creating hyperstable
Trp-cages. Culik et al.12 reported that the fold-stabilizing G10a
mutation (ΔTm = +21 °C) increased the folding rate of TC5b
by only a factor of 2. Two additional mutations, R16K and
P19A, were examined in the case of TC10b,7 and neither was
reported to alter the folding rate appreciably. The P19A
mutation is a particularly destabilizing mutation, ΔTm = −44
°C, as quoted by Culik et al.7 As a result, Feng Gai and co-
workers have proposed that hydrophobic staple (Y3/P19) and
salt-bridge (D9/R16) formation occur on the downhill side of
the folding transition and only stabilize the final state;
essentially, that helix formation is rate determining and sets
the stage for downhill folding events thereafter.
The Arrhenius plots for all Trp-cage dynamics studies
mentioned to this point indicate faster folding rates on warming
(a negative Arrhenius plot slope). Although the slopes for
folding were always less than slopes for the unfolding process,
positive folding Ea values were observed throughout. The one
exception to this is an early study of another stabilizing
mutation, [P12W], which introduces an additional aryl/aryl
interaction and results in more apolar burial. Bunagan et al.13
reported dynamics data for [P12W]-TC5b, Tm = 57 °C, which
are considerably more protein-like (vide infra): a curved plot
for log kF versus 1/T with an increasingly negative Ea at
temperatures well below Tm. Positive Arrhenius slopes
(negative Ea values) usually indicate a compact transition
state with hydrophobic surface burial. The [P12W] mutation
also provided the first notable instance of folding rate
acceleration, 1/kF about 1 μs at 300 Kcorresponding to a
3.5-fold acceleration. Subsequent studies have shown that
P12W is a stabilizing mutation in other Trp-cage species.14
With the exception of the study reported by Qiu et al.,6 all
previous T-jump studies of Trp-cage dynamics have relied on
the disappearance of helical amide I′ bands, either monitored
directly or as the appearance of a random coil amide
absorbance. We view this as a potential source of error in
assessing the rates at which a fully formed Trp-cage fold
appears. There have been several reports8,15 that suggest that
the N-terminal helix is partially retained in unfolded state
ensembles or is a very early on-path state along MD folding
trajectories.1c,16 Indeed, we have proposed the existence of half-
cage species (Figure 1), either as intermediates or as partially
folded species within the “unfolded ensemble”.4,8,17 In the case
of exendin-4, which has a much longer and thus more stable α
helix, the unfolded state in aqueous fluoroalcohol media has a
fully formed helix with cage formation occurring as a separate
docking event (scenario A, Figure 1).
In the case of Trp-cage species with stabilizing mutations in
the α helical segment, an intermediate situation, between A and
B of Figure 1, may apply (vide infra). In support of this scheme,
half-cage structures with an upfield G11-CH2 group appear to
be present within the unfolded ensemble of TC5b and other
less stable Trp-cage analogues.4,8,14 Long-range W6/P12 and
W6/R16 contacts have been identified17 in the unfolded state
of TC5b. In another study,19 it was noted that W6/R16 NOEs
are retained at and slightly above the Tm to a greater extent
than other long-range contacts.
In our 2008 report on the [P19A] mutant of TC10b,8 we
noted this species as an example in which different probes give
radically different Tm data. The CD melt as well as chemical
shift melts for the Hα protons in the N-terminal helix yielded a
Tm of 15 °C. However, the NMR shifts for the ring-current
shifted Hα and Hβ3 sites in Pro18 indicated a fold population
(χF) of only 0.17 at 280 K and an extrapolated Tm below −9
°C. On this basis, the ΔΔGF value for complete cage formation
associated with the P19A mutation is at least 11 kJ/mol, with
our best estimate at 14 kJ/mol. As a result, we were surprised
Figure 1. Half-cage structures, with no ring current shifts at P18 and no sequestration of the Trp indole side chain NH, have interactions between
W6 and the G11-P12 unit which result in upfield ring current shifts in those residues that are not the same as those in the complete cage structure.
Postulated half-cage structures of Trp-cage-forming sequences have either (A) a fully formed N-terminal helix with the W6/P12 interactions as a
helix C-cap (illustrated with a long helix such as that in exendin-4 and earlier incomplete truncation species4,18 or (B) represent transient interactions
within the unfolded ensemble that may or may not be on-path to the full cage structure. Scenario B was first suggested for TC5b.4

by the report7 that [P19A]-TC10b folds as rapidly as the
nonmutated sequence; in our view, it raised the possibility that
all previous Trp-cage folding dynamics may represent just helix
formation, not cage formation.
Herein we report our efforts to find dynamics probes that
exclusively reflect the formation of the complete cage structure
and the application of these to determine which structure-
stabilizing features of the Trp-cage are present at this folding
transition state and which form after the transition state.
Throughout, we have relied primarily on NMR resonances that
display very large structuring shifts due to ring-current effects
that are present only when the complete cage structure forms.
As expected,20,21 these highly shifted resonances display
measurable line broadening when in equilibrium with a
significant unfolded state population.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Peptide Synthesis and Characterization. Many of the
systems examined herein, or used for the evaluation of
mutational ΔΔG-values, have been reported previously,8,11,14,15
and the others were prepared in the same way (automated
FMOC-based peptide synthesis) and similarly purified and
characterized by NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism
(CD) melts. All of the new Trp-cage analogues in this report
displayed the expected (M + 2H)+2 and (M + 3H)+3 molecular
ions by electrospray mass spectrometry (Bruker Esquire Ion
Trap). In addition, all species with ΔGU values greater than −2
displayed the diagnostic long-range NOEs and the upfield shifts
at G11Hα2, P18Hα, Hβ3 (or A18Hα and Hβ), and L7Hα as
well as downfield shifts at R16 proton sites that reflect Trp-cage
fold formation.8,14,15 The complete list, including reference
compounds, appears in Table 1. All ΔGU values have been
recalculated based on the structuring shifts, expressed as
chemical shift deviations (CSDs, the observed shift minus the
coil reference value) at residue 18 so as to reflect complete cage
structure formation rather than helix content. In contrast, CD
measures and the resulting Tm values from the melting curve
reflect only loss of helicity.
NMR Relaxation Methods for Obtaining Folding
Dynamics. The dynamics data obtained at U.W. are based
on NMR resonance line broadening associated with exchange
between the folded state and a populated unfolded state which
lacks the structuring shifts associated with fold formation.20,21
For most of the studies reported herein, this analysis assumes a
two-state equilibrium between a fully folded cage state and an
unfolded ensemble that has no structuring shifts for the probes
examinedproton sites at residue 18 in an undocked polyProII
unit.
For the few studies based on line broadening at the G11Hα2
site (panel A of Figure 2, Figure 4, and Table 2, vide infra), we
needed to take into account the presence of half-cage species in
the precage unfolded ensemble. A half-cage model (see Figure
1, vide supra) was required to obtain expectation chemical
shifts for G11Hα2 at different temperatures in both water and
water/trifluoroethanol (TFE) mixtures. Our chosen model for
incomplete cage formation was the NAUYU QWLKD GGPSS
GRPAA sequence.22 The N-terminal changes, including two
helix-favoring Aib residues (U in the sequence shown) are
favorable for helix and half-cage formation, while the Ala
substitution for two C-terminal prolines compromises full cage
formation. NAUYU QWLKD GGPSS GRPPPS,8 which lacks
the C-terminal changes displays helix (CD) and cage melting
points that are nearly the same: 59 and 53.5 °C, respectively. In
the case of NAUYU QWLKD GGPSS GRPAA (CD Tm = 23
°C), helix and half-cage formation occurs. From Table 1, the
ΔΔGU values for P19A and P18A are −11.8 and ca. −1.2 kJ/
mol, respectively. The fractional population of the complete
cage structure (χcage) for this model based on the ring current
shift observed at A18α (2.69 ppm upfield in [P18A]-TC16a at
280 K) is 0.20 (280 K), 0.15 (290 K), 0.094 (300 K), and 0.056
(310 K) in pH 7 aqueous buffer. With the addition of TFE to
30 vol %, the χcage-value increases to 0.33 at 280 K (and 0.11 at
310 K). These results allowed us to calculate expectation

mutants, the A18 Hα and Hβ) resonances from either the reference
values for the fully folded state, or from the observed 280 K values
when Tm(CD) > 80 °C, are used to obtain the fraction folded (χcage)
value at the higher temperatures. A 1%/10 °C decrease in the fully
folded CSD on warming is assumed. The observed CSD temperature
gradients (which are linear) for extreme ring-current-shifted sites of
hyperstable (Tm > 90 °C) cyclic constructs
23 have varied from 0.070 to
0.145%/°C in the 290−320 K temperature range. cBold data indicate
large differences between the CD and NMR measures of fold stability.

11Hα2 shifts from the observed values for the ensemble
containing small amounts of the fully folded species. To correct
the observed G11Hα2 δ-values to those due to the “pre-cage
ensemble” including a partially populated half-cage, we assumed
that the full-cage species would display the usual far upfield
shift, given by δ = 0.488 + 0.0036 (T-280) ppm.
The two types of NMR line width data employed are
illustrated for TC10b and its [P18A]-analogue in Figure 2.
The excess broadening observed for the probes is equated
with Δex and eq 120,21,24 is used to calculate the value of kF at
each temperature.

The values of χF and χU (= 1 − χF) are obtained from the
CSD of the probe: χF = CSD
obs/CSD100%. The Δν in eq 1 is
given as the CSD100% and has a small temperature dependence
(see Table 1). The kU value at each temperature is calculated as
kU = kF(1 − χF)(χF)−1.
In the case of [G11-13Cα]-Trp-cage species, the excess
broadening at G11Hα2 (versus G11Hα3) was analyzed based
on several models as described in the Ph.D. thesis of Barua.22
The model using the expectation shifts from the NAUYU
QWLKD GGPSS GRPAA sequence half-cage model (vide
supra) affords rates that are, within experimental error, in
agreement with fluorescence-monitored T-jump studies (Figure
4) and IR-monitored T-jump studies subsequently reported by
Culik et al.7 In Figure 4, the errors in the ln kF values from the
fluorescence-monitored T-jump study vary from ±0.07 to
±0.17. Our best estimates of the error in both folding rates
from the NMR experiment are also included on the graph.
Assuming a random coil shift for G11Hα2 in the “unfolded
state” affords a folding rate that is faster by a factor of 1.6. As a
result, the same analysis using the G11Hα2 reference shifts
from the half-cage model was employed for the other
[G11-13Cα]-TC species examined.
In the case of dynamics studies based on the alanine-CH3
signal of [P18A]-analogues, the increase in line width of this
signal is the measure that affords dynamics data; the chemical
shift provides the equilibrium constant at each temperature.
The 100% folded values for this signal, taken from the most
stable Trp-cage analogues with this mutation, are 0.25 ppm
(CSD = −1.14 ppm) and 0.20 ppm (CSD = −1.19 ± 0.005
ppm), respectively, for species with and without a P12W
substitution. The sensitivity of alanine-CH3 resonances to quite
small Δex terms is illustrated in Figure 3.
In a typical experiment, the line width at half height is
measured for two or three well-resolved alanine methyls that
appear within 0.15 ppm of the random coil value when in the
folded state. A high and low value for Δex is determined by
direct half height width comparisons to these references. Two
additional values for Δex are obtained by modeling the A18β
line shape in a custom built Excel spreadsheet using the A18β
coupling constant measured at the lowest temperature and
varying the line width (Δsim) until the observed half height

extent to which it shifts to higher δ values on warming. In contrast, the downfield G11Hα shows much less broadening and hardly shifts on warming.

due to D-Ala10β, which appears quite close to the coil reference shift
(1.39 ppm) for Ala-Hβ and shifts less than 0.03 ppm over a 40 °C
range, provides the intrinsic line width parameter (Δ°) for the
experiment. The line width increment due to exchange broadening
results in a wider A18β peak with less separation, %-dip,20,21 between
the two lines of the doublet.

width and the %-dip are reproduced. The Δex values from those
two simulations are given by Δsim − Δ°, with Δ° as the average
intrinsic broadening of the reference methyl signals. This
provides four measures of Δex; the average value is employed in
eq 1. With ln kF values in the 12−14 range, the typical errors in
ln kF are ±0.18, and the largest errors observed were ±0.38.
Fluorescence-Monitored T-Jump Data. The experiments
were performed at the University of Florida using an apparatus
and methodology that has been described in detail previously.25
Briefly, protein was dissolved at concentrations 20−30 μM in
50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) and then flowed through a
silica capillary. Counter-propagating infrared laser pulses then
induce a rapid (within <30 ns) but transient temperature
increase of typically 6−8 °C, which triggers unfolding of the
protein in a single-exponential process as monitored by
tryptophan fluorescence. Fitting the exponential process to a
two-state kinetic model that employs the equilibrium folding
free energy determined from CD spectroscopy, we obtain the
characteristic folding and unfolding rates shown in Figures 4
and 5.
Mutational ΔΔG and ΦF Values. The data appearing in
Table 1 provide multiple determinations for a number of single
site mutations and for acidification (pH 2.5 stabilities versus
those at pH 7). We designate the acidification effect as ΔpH:
ΔpH = 3.13 ± 0.61 kJ/mol (over 10 observed cases). Three
single site mutation effects, all fold-destabilizing, are also
observed in three or more instances: Δ(S14A) = 5.55 ± 0.43 (n
= 3), Δ(R16nva) = 5.5 ± 1.6 (n = 4), and Δ(P17A) = 2.37 ±
0.46 kJ/mol (n = 3). All of these are based on the ΔGU300K
values in Table 1. A P12W mutation was also examined in
multiple situations (ΔΔGUmut = −1.7 − +2.9 kJ/mol); no single
value can be given for this mutation, vide infra.
The mutational (or acidification) ΦF values are calculated at
300−305 K as

The calculation was repeated using the high and low
estimates of the folding rates and with both the consensus
ΔΔGU value and the specific one for the system under study if
the latter was available. This defined the range of values allowed
for ΦF.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The original hallmark for folding dynamics in our laboratory,
the broadening of the far upfield G11Hα2 signal, has been
employed for additional dynamics measures. There are
numerous potential pitfalls in the quantitative use of this
probe: the signal is a doublet of doublets of doublets in H2O
and the coupling constants likely change as the unfolded state
population increases on warming. In addition, the “unfolded”
reference shift value cannot be equated with the random coil
shift for Gly-Hα due to half-cage contributions in the
“unfolded” state. These difficulties are reflected by reduced
precision and accuracy in Arrhenius plots based on line
broadening of this probe (Figure 4, vide infra).
To allow the observations of both the extremely shifted Gly-
Hα2 and less shifted Hα3 resonance throughout a melt in 13C-
edited 1D spectra, a series of 13Cα-Gly-11 labeled (G*)
peptides were prepared: X-YAQWLKDG-G*-PSSGRPPPS (X
= DA-, GA-, and N-). The X = DA species is TC10b. The two
other species (X = GA- and N-, TC11b1, and TC12b) have
also been previously characterized by NMR and CD studies;8
the stability data appear in Table 1. The 13C-edited 1D spectra
for 13Cα-TC10b appear as panel A of Figure 2. A number of
alternative analyses for extracting dynamics data were
examined.22 For the final analyses, we chose to model the
expectation “unfolded state” shifts as the temperature-depend-
ent shifts for the Gly11-CH2 of NAUYUQ-WLKDG-Gly11-
PSSGRPAA. This analogue forms the complete cage structure
only to a slight extent: χcage = 0.1 at 298 K (see Materials and
Methods) since it lacks the terminal hydrophobic staple, the
Y3/P19 interaction.
The NMR dynamics method with this probe, based on the
line widths shown in part on panel A of Figure 2, provided a
less than optimal Arrhenius plot even with the calibration of
“unfolded” G11α2 shifts provided by the half-cage ensemble
(Figure 4). The wide variance at the higher temperatures likely
reflects errors in coupling constant estimates becoming a larger
portion of the net broadening at the higher temperatures. The
folding rate estimate at 300 K, a portion of the plot that was
linear, was 1/kF = 1.37 μs.
The dynamics for TC10b were also probed by fluorescence-
monitored T-jump experiments. The resulting dynamics are

compared with the NMR data as Arrhenius plots in Figure 4.
The two methods are, within experimental error, in agreement
at the reference temperature. Our best estimate for 1/kF at 298
K is 1.4 μs from this comparison. This is accord with the 1.5 μs
value obtained by the Gai laboratory.7
Even though we still have some concerns about the validity
of exchange-broadening at G11Hα2 as a probe, and the number
of assumptions required in the analysis used to extract Δex, we
also report here the folding dynamics derived for the two other
13C-Gly labeled analogues, TC11b1 and TC12b. These are
given together with the data for TC10b in Table 2. For
TC11b1 and TC12b, we employed the same analysis to arrive
at both the Δex value and unfolded ensemble shifts for the
upfield shifted G11Hα.
The slower folding noted for TC11b1 (versus TC10b) may
reflect a folding transition which includes the extension of the
helix to the N-terminus of the sequence in which case the lack
of an efficient N-cap in the GAYA- sequence could increase the
barrier. The ΦF value for the D1G mutation is 1.26, based on
the data in Table 2. The faster folding observed for TC12b
(versus TC11b1), even though the fold is further destabilized
by helix truncation is puzzling; it can, however, be rationalized
if helix N-capping has a greater impact on the folding barrier
than on fold stability. In this regard it should be noted that the
greater fold stability observed for TC12b in 30% TFE,
presumably due to helix stabilization in this medium, is not
reflected in a much more rapid folding rate; rather the stability
appears to represent retarded unfolding upon the addition of
the fold stabilizing cosolvent.
We have continued to monitor G11Hα2 line widths in our
studies of Trp-cage unfolding, but the potential problems
associated with this signal, particularly the questions concerning
the temperature dependence of the chemical shift in the
“unfolded ensemble”, have led us to view this as a less than
ideal measure of complete fold formation. In contrast, the large
upfield shifts at the P18Hα (CSD = −2.33) and P18Hβ3 (CSD
= −2.14 ppm, at 280 K), based on the shifts observed in a
hyperstable cyclic construct14,23 appeared to be superior
measures of full cage formation. These appear only on
complete cage formation; the P18Hα signal is usually
overlapped with other peaks, but the P18Hβ3 signal appears
far upfield with no other signals nearby. Were it not for its
complex coupling, it would be an ideal NMR dynamics probe.
Both signals are observed in the 2D NMR data of all analogues,
and the derived CSDs provide χcage measures (typically in
agreement to ±0.02) and the ΔGU data shown in Table 1.
We reported the effects of individual Pro to Ala mutations on
Trp-cage stability in 2008.8 As previously noted the P19A
mutation had the most profound destabilizing effect; the other
mutations were only slightly destabilizing. Of these, the [P18A]
mutation introduces a far upfield doublet (typically in the 0.2−
0.8 ppm spectral window even on partial melting), an ideal
situation for applying the line width difference method for
deriving folding dynamics first reported by Olsen et al.20 The
100%-folded CSD for the A18α signal of our most stable
analogue is −2.7 ppm. That this value is slightly larger than the
P18α structuring shift likely reflects a tighter packing onto the
W6 indole ring that is allowed when the steric clashes of the Cγ
methylene of the proline are absent. Of particular significance,
any unfolded species in which the A18 methyl is not docked
over the indole ring of the central Trp, including half-cage
species, would display random coil shifts for both the β and α
sites of Ala18. As a result, the [P18A]-Trp-cage mutants
provide both a dynamics probe and a means for evaluating the
ΔGU of the full cage structure.
The [P18A] mutant of TC10b was examined by both NMR
relaxation (line width measurements) and fluorescence-
monitored T-jump experiments in 2005. The Arrhenius plots
that resulted from these two studies appear in Figure 5. Upon
comparison with the T-jump studies in Figure 4, it is clear that
the [P18A] mutation (ΔΔGU300 ≈ −1.05 kJ/mol; see Table 1)
effects a retardation of the folding rate (ΦF ≈ 0.8), particularly
at the higher temperatures. The mutation significantly reduces
the slope of the T-jump folding Arrhenius plot.
In the case of [P18A]-TC10b, however, the agreement
between the fluorescence monitored T-jump and NMR
determination of folding dynamics was very poor even after
taking into account the greater error in the NMR
determinations. In the ln k units shown in Figure 5, the errors
ranged from ±0.14 to ±0.34 in the NMR dynamics experiment,
versus a typical value of ±0.07 for the T-jump data points.
The NMR dynamics analysis based on A18β line widths
(with the other Me doublets providing the measure of intrinsic
broadening for the system) gave a folding Arrhenius plot with a
distinctly positive slope. In addition, the NMR relaxation
method afforded rates that were 2−3-fold slower; this was not
fully rationalized and the basis for not publishing the results at
that time.
Another distinction in Arrhenius plot comparison is the
difference in apparent Tm by fluorescence versus the NMR
measures. If we recalculate kF and kU values from the T-jump
relaxation rates using the fraction folded values derived from
the A18β signal NMR melt, the rate discrepancy remains. Since
we viewed the upfield methyl signal of [P18A] Trp-cage
mutants as a nearly ideal NMR dynamics probe, we have
repeated a study of [P18A]-TC10b with freshly prepared
material and using more precise line fitting procedures which
we developed in other studies.21 In this second determination,
we once again obtained a positive Arrhenius folding plot slope
with 1/kF = 3.7 μs at 300 K.
We now suggest a rationale: that many stable Trp-cage
species have partially folded states, with cage formation still
incomplete, that are both as helical as the native state and place
the Trp indole in an environment that quenches its
fluorescence. Thus, both the fluorescence measures and prior
Trp-cage dynamics measures based on helical IR signals may
not be probes of complete cage formation. We employed
[P18A]-Trp-cages for our remaining studies, with the exchange
line broadening at Ala18-Hβ as the dynamics probe.
We first examined the possibility of extending this method to
an ultrastable Trp-cage system,11 TC16b (DAYAQ WLKDa
GPSSa RPPPS). If we assume the folding rate increase for

the random coil shift for a Gly-Hα was employed instead of the
estimated unfolded ensemble shift. The effects of choice of unfolded
reference are much smaller (5−20%) for TC11b1 and TC12b.

G10a observed for TC10b by Culik et al.12 applies here as well,
this would put the estimated rate for TC16b at 300 K at 1/kF =
0.65−0.85 μs. [P18A]-TC16b, with a Tm of 76 °C at pH 7, did
not display enough exchange broadening to yield a useful
Arrhenius plot. However, with the fold destabilization observed
at pH 2.5 (ΔΔGUΔpH = −3.1 kJ/mol, Table 1), useful data
could be collected; again a positive slope was observed (from
305−320 K) with 1/kF = 0.93 ± 0.18 μs at 305 K (Figure S1,
Supporting Information (SI)). This fast folding rate, under
conditions where the salt bridge is removed by aspartate
protonation, suggests that the salt bridge is not a required
feature for accelerated cage formation.
We also collected dynamics data for the [P17A,P18A]
mutant of TC16b at pH 2.5 (Figure S2, SI). Over the 285−315
K range, a positive Arrhenius slope was observed with a 1/kF =
2.20 ± 0.19 μs at 305 K. The ΦF value calculated for the P17A
mutation was ca. 0.85 at the 305 K comparison point. We
attribute the folding rate retardation of the [P17A]-mutation, in
combination with P18A, to destabilization of the polyProII
conformation in the C-terminal segment. This conformation is
required for proper docking against Y3 and W6 in cage
formation and is reflected in the near unity ΦF value for the
[P17A] and [P18A] mutations.
More dramatic destabilizations were required to obtain data
at pH 7. An Arg16 to norvaline mutation proved suitable.
This mutation, by removing the entire guanidine-group,
eliminates both the H-bonding and Coulombic components of
the D9/R16 salt bridge. The ΔΔGU values for [R16nva]
mutations are comparable to, or significantly larger, than those
due to acidification (see Table 1). This mutation, in
combination with the [P18A] mutation, allowed dynamics
studies at pH 7. The [R16nva, P18A]-TC16b analogue gave
excellent data which yielded a slightly curved Arrhenius plot for
ln kF (Figure 6). Similarly curved Arrhenius plots are typically
observed for small protein folds.26 The maximum rate, 1/kF =
0.95 ± 0.10 μs, was observed between 290−305 K. Since we do
not have data for [P18A]-TC16b at pH 7, we cannot calculate a
ΦF value (see SI, note 1). This observation also suggests that
salt-bridge formation does not occur until after the folding
transition state.
We next turned to examination of the C-terminal segment of
the helix in the Trp-cage. Studies already presented above
indicated that helix N-capping appears to be required in a
transition state leading to structures that provided the full ring
current shielding of Gly11 Hα2. The greater fold stability of
TC10b and TC13b (versus TC5b) is attributable to improve-
ments in helicity. As already noted,27 in prior dynamics studies
relying on IR probes, helicity improvements resulted in folding
acceleration, with a near unity ΦF value. We opted to examine a
destabilizing mutation at the C-terminus of the helix, A8G, to
obtain another helicity-associated ΦF value. From Table 1, this
substitution results in a 4.1 kJ/mol cage fold destabilization at
300 K. For this species, [A8G,P18A]-TC16b, with χU values
greater than 0.1 at all temperatures above 300 K at both pH 2.5
and 7, dynamics data could be obtained at both pH 7 and 2.5.
The resulting Arrhenius plots appear in Figure 7.
Since we were able to obtain dynamics data for [P18A]-
TC16b at pH 2.5, the comparison at this pH provides a direct
measure of the ΦF value for the A8G mutation. The folding
time constant at the 305 K comparison point is 5.1 μs for
[A8G,P18A]-TC16b, which corresponds to ΦF = 1.19 ± 0.08.
Essentially the same value would be obtained at pH 7 using the
extrapolated27 folding time constant for [P18A]-TC16b.
This example also provides the first example of a direct
folding dynamics comparison at pH 7 versus pH 2.5. In Figure
7, the Arrhenius plots for folding are, within experimental error,
identical at the two pH’s. The enhanced fold stability at pH 7 is
exclusively the result of a decreased unfolding rate. The
favorable Coulombic attraction associated with the D9/R16 salt
bridge is present in the folded state but essentially gone at the
unfolding/folding transition state.
The most destabilizing single site mutation for the Trp-cage,
other than P19A and Y3A, is the S14A mutation. The basis for
this is now established.14,23,27 In all cases, Hγ of the serine
hydroxyl forms an H-bond to OC-Gly11. In the crystal
structure23 of a cyclic Trp-cage that lacks the R16/D9 salt
bridge due to the pH employed for crystallization, the S14Hγ/
OC-Gly11 interaction is clearly present and the Ser-Oγ
accepts an H-bond from R16HN (the amide NH). In analogues
with an R16/D9 salt-bridge, the Arg side chain wrapping
around the indole ring places R16Hε, a side chain NH, in
position for H-bonding to Ser-Oγ either directly or via a tightly

associated water molecule.23,27a These H-bonding interactions
are required to allow the burial of the polar S14 side chain in
the hydrophobic core, and they contribute a net stabilization of
the cage fold. As a result, even though the introduction of an
additional alanine in the 310 helix might be expected to provide
some net stabilization to this secondary structure element, an
S14A mutation is fold-destabilizing (ΔΔGU = −5.5 ± 0.4 kJ/
mol). The dynamics effects of the S14A mutation were
examined for [S14A,P18A]-TC16b. For this system, the ΔΔGU
for the [S14A]-mutation was −5.3 kJ/mol at both pH 7 and pH
2.5, but the dynamics probe was free of interfering peak
overlaps only at pH 7. [S14A,P18A]-TC16b displayed a nearly
constant folding rate (1/kF = 1.73 ± 0.15 μs) in the 295−320 K
temperature span (Figure 9, vide infra). Since we could not
obtain dynamics data for [P18A]-TC16b at pH 7, a direct
comparison for a ΦF calculation does not exist (see SI, note 2).
The slightly more stable [A8G,P18A]-TC16b analogue, which
has a comparable fold stability (ΔGU 1.2 kJ/mol greater than
that of [S14A,P18A]-TC16b), provides the best comparison
point. The folding time constants are 5.1 and 1.73 μs,
respectively, for [A8G,P18A]-TC16b and [S14A,P18A]-
TC16b: the [S14A] mutant folds faster than the more stable
[A8G] mutant. From this comparison, it is clear that the
[S14A] mutation does not result in the dramatic folding rate
reduction that might be expected for such a destabilizing effect.
If the S14 side chain is already buried at the folding transition
state, the web of stabilizing side chain H-bonding interactions is
not fully established. No matter how we estimate it, ΦF is much
less than 0.5 for the [S14A] mutation.
Other than replacing long chain residues with alanine in
helices8,9 and the Gly to D-Ala mutations11,12 in the C-terminal
cap of the Trp-cage’s N-terminal helix, a [P12W] mutation13,14
is the most fold stabilizing mutation reported for the Trp-cage.
In the case of TC5b, this mutation has been reported to have a
stabilizing effect (a positive ΔTm by CD) and provides a
significantly greater acceleration of the folding rate.7 This
published account indicates a ΦF in excess of 1.2. The same
ΔTm for a [P12W] mutation has also been observed for TC16b
and a circularly permuted Trp-cage sequence and ΔΔGU values
on the order of +2 to +3 kJ/mol were derived14 for this
mutation. The data in Table 1 indicate that a [P12W] mutation
is not fold stabilizing for Trp-cages with the Pro18 to Ala
mutation, ΔΔGUP12W values at 300 K are −2.4 (for [P18A]-
TC10b), −1.3 (for [P18A]-TC16b), and −1.7 kJ (for
[S14A,P18A]-TC16b).
Two explanations for the fold stabilizing effect of the
[P12W]-mutation in Trp-cage structures have been suggested:
the formation of an enthalpically favorable edge-to-face (EtF)
indole/indole cluster,13 and greater apolar surface burial14
associated with the W12/P17,18 as well as the W12/W6
interactions; see Figure 8. Both of these may apply in the case
of Trp-cages that retain the C-terminal tri-Pro unit, but the
relative extent to which they affect energies of the folding
transition state and the final folded structure are not known.
In the case of TC5b, rate comparisons7,13 suggest that the
[P12W] mutation may have a greater stabilizing effect on the
folding transition state, ΦF ≥ 1.2. We examined the dynamics of
[P12W]-Trp-cages in two species, both of which also had the
[P18A] mutation that provides our preferred dynamics probe.
Although an indole/indole aryl cluster could still be a feature of
the folding transition state, with a [P18A] mutation in place,
the extent of apolar surface burial resulting is significantly
diminished (Figure 8). This is our rationale for the observation
that the [P12W] mutation was a fold-destabilizing rather than
stabilizing effect when the [P18A] mutation was present. In the
case of [P12W,P18A]-TC13b, the net effect of the double
mutation was a 1.1 kJ/mol destabilization; the addition of the
[P18A] mutation to [P12W]-TC13b corresponded to a 4 kJ/
mol loss in fold stability. The folding time constants observed
for [P12W,P18A]-TC13b were quite rapid (see Figure S3, SI),
with a positive slope for the ln kF versus 1/T plot: 1/kF = 1.5 ±
0.15 μs (at 305 K) and 0.9 ± 0.2 μs (at 295 K). However, the
slope of the Arrhenius plot for unfolding was significantly less
steep than those observed for other [P18A]-Trp-cage species of
comparable fold stability. Extrapolated kF values from other
[P18A]-Trp-cage species, based on ΦF values for substitutions
in the helices, suggest that the [P12W] mutation provides a
modest folding acceleration at the lower temperatures even
though it has a net fold destabilizing effect, corresponding to a
significant negative ΦF value.
In the case of the other Trp2-cage examined in the present
study, [P12W,S14A,P18A]-TC16b, a direct comparison is
available (Figure 9). In this construct, the [P12W] mutation
was destabilizing by 1.7 kJ/mol at 300 K (Table 1).
In this example we also observed a diminished slope for ln kU
vs 1/T. The destabilization of the fold associated with the
[P12W] mutation predominantly results from accelerated
unfolding particularly at the lower temperatures. The loss of
curvature in the folding Arrhenius plot presumably reflects a

mutants. The hydrophobic cluster consisting of the W12 indole ring

[P18A] mutation.

change in ΔCp‡ and signals a change in apolar surface burial at
the transition state. Finally, at the lowest temperatures there is a
significant increase, at least 2.2-fold (4.1 ± 1.9), in the folding
rate associated with the [P12W] mutation. This places the ΦF
value for the [P12W] mutation in the range of −0.7 to −1.0 at
275 K.
■ CONCLUSIONS
Fold stability data are reported for 14 new Trp-cage species,
some at both acidic and neutral pH values. These systems
include a number of cases in which the circular dichroism
(which detects only net helicity) provides higher Tm’s and
measures of folded population (χF) than chemical shifts that
report on formation of the complete cage structure. These
observations indicate partial structuring without full cage
formation in a number of species with either compromised
cage features or mutations that enhance intrinsic helicity.8,9 The
single site mutations that resulted in the largest decreases in
cage formation, with much less effect on helix formation, were
P19A ≫ S14A > P17A > R16nva. Since our interest lay in
examining the rates at which the full cage motif forms, we chose
chemical shift melts at residue 18 sites as the measure for
obtaining a set of fold stability measures (as ΔGU at 300 K,
Table 1) for both the new analogues and prior reference
constructs: these reflect complete cage formation. Previously
noted mutational effects on cage stability were, with one
exception, confirmed by these new measures of folded fractions.
The exception was the P12W mutation; the new analogues
included instances where a P12W mutation was fold
destabilizing rather than fold stabilizing as was the case in
both the original instance13 and more recent14 studies.
Many of the new analogues bear a [P18A] mutation, which
is, in the absence of a [P12W] mutation, fold-destabilizing by
only 1.2 kJ/mol. The exchange broadening of the methyl
resonance of the alanine introduced in place of P18 served as
our primary NMR dynamics probe. This method of folding
dynamics analysis requires the observation of exchange
broadening due to the equilibrium between the fully folded
state and states that have P18A undocked from Trp6 and thus
lack the 1.13−1.19 upfield ring current shift at 18Hβ. A pseudo-
two-state assumption was applied to derive the fold populations
essential for the extraction of kF and kU values. We assume that
the equilibrium fraction of the “unfolded state ensemble” can
be derived from the observed chemical shift of a probe, taking it
as a population weighted average of the random coil value and
the fully folded value. If other states with different chemical
shifts were populated, this analysis would be incorrect and this
would be apparent in non-Arrhenius behavior for the derived
folding/unfolding rate constants. In other applications of this
dynamics analysis method,21,36 we have observed dramatic
slope changes in Arrhenius plots and disagreement in rates
derived by probes placed in different sites for systems with
more complicated folding scenarios. The strict Arrhenius
behavior seen in Figures 6, 7, 9 and in the supporting figures,
thus serves as a confirmation of two-state behavior for the final
docking event that provides the native fold.
The inherent limitation of the NMR dynamics method
prevented the determination of folding rates for some of the
most stable Trp-cage analogues that have been prepared. The
extent of line broadening was insufficient for species with 1/kF
values greater than 0.7 μs and in cases where a “P18A undocked
from Trp6” state does not become populated (χU ≥ 0.08) at
temperatures below 310 K. In some cases, dynamics were
measured at pH 2.5 to take advantage of the fold destabilizing
effect of Asp1,9 protonation (ΔΔG = 3.1 kJ/mol) to increase
the unfolded state population and thus increases the extent of
exchange broadening that can be observed providing folding
rate constants with greater precision. Ten [P18A]-Trp-cage
species have been examined at either pH 2.5 or pH 7, one of
them at both pH values.
All of our data indicate that the N-terminal helix (residues
1−8) is fully formed at the cage folding transition state. This is
consistent with a number of recent MD simulations.1c,27b,28,29
The ΦF value for an [A8G] mutation was 1.19 ± 0.08 and
similar, slightly in excess of unity, ΦF values are implied by the
systematic increases in folding rate constants for Trp-cages with
additional alanine residues in the N-terminal helix based both
on the present study and a prior published account.7 A more
limited study of exchange broadening at the upfield shifted
G11Hα2 in the present study indicated that more effective N-
capping residues at the first position of this helix also accelerate
folding. The importance of the N-capping interaction has also
been supported by a recent dynamics study.30 Near unity ΦF
values were also found for the [P17A] and (to the extent that
we can approximate it) the [P18A] mutations. The simplest
rationale for these is that docking of the P17−P19 unit onto the
Trp-bearing helix is favored when this unit has a high
preference for the poly-ProII conformation that is present in
the fully folded state.
In contrast to this, we observe negative ΦF values for the
P12W mutation when the P18A mutation is also present, and
small fractional ΦF values were observed for ionization state
changes and the R16nva and S14A mutations. The near
absence of folding rate retardation due to the R16nva mutation
and protonation of the Asp in the D9/R16 salt bridge indicates
that the fold-stabilizing D9/R16 interaction (ΔΔGU ≈ −5 kJ/
mol) forms after the cage formation transition state. Gai and
co-worker have reached the same conclusion, based on an
R16K mutation.7 This conclusion, post-transition state
formation, was also extended this to the P19/Y3 hydrophobic
staple. In our view the latter point requires further study using
cage-specific probes, and efforts in this direction are in progress.
A recent transition state interface sampling modified Markov
State Model31 finds breaking of the salt-bridge as a very early
event in the unfolding trajectory, well prior to any loss of
helicity. However, premature salt bridge formation continues32
to appear as a kinetic trap in folding simulations.
The S14A mutation has a dramatic destabilizing effect on the
cage fold (ΔΔGU = −5.6 kJ/mol) and is located in the 310
helical segment of the Trp-cage. This structural element has
been a subject of discussion in MD simulations,2,28,32 and
experimental evidence for residual flexibility at this site has been
reported based on both NMR structure ensembles8,14,19,33 and
crystal structures.23 Gai and co-workers7 have observed a more
rapid phase (ca. 300 ns) in some FT-IR-monitored T-jump
experiments which was attributed to the 310 helix. Two
experimental reports that have implicated an intermediate state
populated at temperatures near the apparent Tm have also
focused on the G11-G15 segment. Ahmed et al.34 indicated that
this structure was more compact with closer contacts about W6,
but a less well-formed 310 helix. Rovo et al.
33 have calculated
that this intermediate has a longer, nearly complete, α-helix in
the G11-G15 segment. Whether this intermediate, which
appears to be most populated at somewhat higher temper-
atures, is an on-path folding intermediate at these or lower
temperatures, is unclear. If some compact intermediate is on-

path, one possibility is that the H-bonding interactions that
allow burial of the S14 side chain hydroxyl form after the P17−
P19 docking event and are the basis for the late conformational
change in the G11-G15 segment. D9/R16 salt-bridge formation
may also contribute to this conformational change.
P12 is also within the 310 helical segment of the Trp-cage.
While further data, including dynamics for [P12W]-species that
retain the P17,18,19 unit based on NMR probes within that
unit, are required to fully clarify the nature of the contacts made
by Trp12 in the folding transition state, the present study does
provide insights. The rapid folding of [P12W,P18A]-species
implies some fold-favoring interactions at Trp12. Partial
formation of a Trp6/Trp12 aryl ring cluster at the transition
state may be the rationale for folding that is more rapid, even
though the [P12W] mutation is destabilizing in the ultimate
folded state. Such a propensity to form an indole/indole cluster
in the unfolded state ensemble could favor prestructuring at the
transition state. This local structure may, however, differ from
that in the final folded state with, in the case of the [P18A]-
analogues, favorable interactions present only at the folding
transition state. Our analysis suggests that with a proline
present at position 18, additional hydrophobic interactions that
are not present in [P18A] analogues, result upon full cage
formation and provide stabilization of the fully folded state.
While there are unanswered questions concerning the Trp-
cage folding pathway, with a number of groups having reported
data suggesting that Trp-cage folding is not a two-state
system,19,28,33−35 these data are largely associated with structure
melting analysis rather dynamics measurements. Both T-jump
and NMR relaxation experiments are consistent with a net two-
state process, with fewer exceptions.7,28 With the present study,
it is apparent that mutations that increase the propensity to
form any of the local secondary structure features of the Trp-
cage fold produce folding rate increases, likely due to partial or
complete structuring of these units prior to the ultimate folding
transition state. In more stable Trp-cage sequences, there may
be considerable folding trajectory variability: concerted
formation of the full cage structure from an unfolded state
ensemble when the N-terminal helix is not intrinsically
favorable versus partial, variable degrees of prestructuring of
the individual secondary structure elements (most notably the
N-terminal helix, but also the poly-ProII segment and possibly
half-cage species). The NMR dynamics method employed
herein affords the slowest time constant involved in an
equilibrium between two states of a probe that have a large
chemical shift difference. By employing a site with ring current
shifts that only appear on complete docking of residues 17−19
upon the Trp/Tyr-bearing helix focuses our study on the,
presumably late, cage-forming step. The Arrhenius plots for
folding that result imply a significant barrier, and we continue
to view this ultimate step in the formation of Trp-cage as
effectively a two-state process.
