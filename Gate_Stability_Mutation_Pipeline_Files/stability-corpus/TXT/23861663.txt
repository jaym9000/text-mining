Abstract
The ability to design thermostable proteins offers enormous potential for the development of novel protein bioreagents. In
this work, a combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the Tm of the flavin
mononucleotide based fluorescent protein Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31 Celsius, thus extending its applicability in
thermophilic systems. Briefly, the method includes five steps, the single mutant computer screening to identify
thermostable mutant candidates, the experimental evaluation to confirm the positive selections, the computational
redesign around the thermostable mutation regions, the experimental reevaluation and finally the multiple mutations
combination. The adopted method is simple and effective, can be applied to other important proteins where other methods
have difficulties, and therefore provides a new tool to improve protein thermostability.

Introduction
There is a considerable interest in proteins as therapeutics,
biochemical reagents and catalysts. Many proteins tend to degrade
on storage or use, and the instability hampers their applications in
many aspects. Protein stability is very important to its application in
biotechnology. For an industrial enzyme, higher thermostability
means longer survival times and higher reaction temperature, which
usually accelerates enzymatic catalysis and reduces contamination.
Thus, proteins with good stability are highly desirable. Currently
there are three main protein engineering methods, namely directed
evolution [1], sequence consensus [2] and rational design [3]. Each
of the three protein engineering methods has its own strength and
weakness, and all have been used to improve protein thermostability
with some success. Directed evolution uses methods such as DNA
shuffling or error-prone PCR to create different mutations and
employs quick screening essays to select the optimal ones. Sequence
consensus involves the comparison of the targeted protein sequence
to a series of homolog sequences and changes the amino acid at a
specific position to that most frequently seen in the homologs.
Rational design method relies on the 3D structure of a protein.
Once the protein structure is known, the common rational design
approaches include enhancement of core packing [4], removal of
buried polar side chains [5,6], mutation of charged surface residues
[7–9], and introduction of new disulfide bonds [10]. However it is
difficult to predict how well each approach works for a specific
protein and the stability increase is likely caused by a combination of
these effects. The success of rational design depends on the accurate
understanding of the relationship between protein structure and
stability. In principle, each residue in a protein can be substituted by
nineteen natural amino acids but predicting the substitutions’ effect
on stability is very challenging. Many computational screening
methods have been developed to pursue this goal, such as CC/
PBSA [11], EGAD [12], FoldX [13], I-mutant 2.0 [14], Rosetta
[15–17] and etc. Independent assessments of these methods
suggested that all have high efficiency but only moderate accuracy
[18]. A more recent study by Seeliger et. al. [19] using an alchemical
free energy method to study point mutation effects on the
thermostability of a barnase demonstrated much better accuracy.
The free energy method utilizes a well-defined structure (e.g. from
X-ray crystallography) to model the mutational effect on the folded
state and a small peptide (e.g. GXG) to model the effect on the
unfolded state. The thermodynamic cycle used in Seeliger’s study
provides a rigorous way to calculate the free energy change caused
by a point mutation, though the method is computationally much
more expensive than the quick screening methods.
Green fluorescent protein from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria [20]
and its derivatives are widely used in cell imaging to study gene
regulation, protein syntheses, and other biochemical and cellular
processes. However, in the catalytic formation of the chromo-

oxygen-limited cellular microenvironments [22,23]. The discovery
of bacterial blue-light photoreceptor YtvA from Bacillus subtilis [24]
and the SB2 protein from Pseudomonas putida [25], which fluoresce
in the presence or absence of oxygen, provides new opportunities
to study these oxygen-limited systems. YtvA is composed of 261
residues, with an N-terminal segment (residue 1–24), a LOV (light,
oxygen, voltage) domain (25–126), and a C-terminal STAS (sulfate
transporter/anti-s factor antagonist, 148–258) domain. The LOV
and STAS domains are connected by a long linker (127–147). The
crystal structure of the LOV domain complexed with the
chromophore flavin mononucleotide (FMN) has been determined
for both the light and dark states [26]. The LOV domain forms a
stable dimer in vitro [26], with a dissociation constant less than
1027 M. Blue light absorption causes formation of a covalent bond
between Cys62 and C(4a) of FMN. Drepper et al. mutated Cys62
to an alanine residue, which increases the fluorescence of E. coli
cells by tenfold compared to the cells expressing the wild-type
YtvA LOV domain [22]. However the engineered YtvA LOV
(named FbFP hereafter, Flavin mononucleotide based Fluorescent
Protein) only has moderate thermostability (see results below). A
more thermostable FbFP would be desired for studying anaerobic
microorganisms, especially thermophillic ones.
In this work we combined the quick method FoldX [13] and the
slow but more accurate achemical free energy method to search
for more thermostable FbFP mutants. Eighteen single mutants
were selected for experimental testing, thirteen of which showed
higher melting temperature Tm. Subsequently, different single
mutations were combined to yield even higher Tm values.
Materials and Methods
FoldX prediction
The crystal structure of FbFP (residue 21–147 in subunit 1 and
21–146 in subunit 2, pdb code: 2PR5) [26] was used as the
template for mutation, and the FoldX program was utilized to
estimate mutational effects on protein thermostability. Firstly, the
ligand FMN was removed and the structure was minimized using
the ‘RepairPDB’ command. Then, single mutations were screened
by substituting each residue with the other nineteen possible
natural amino acids using ‘PositionScan’ command. Since the
screening was performed separately for the two subunits, the
predicted DDG values for the same mutation by FoldX, slightly
different due to the structure asymmetry, were averaged. The
predicted stabilizing single mutations were built in both subunits
using ‘BuildModel’ command for further free energy calculations.
Free energy calculation
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out using
Gromacs 4.5 [27,28], with the Gromos53A6 force field [29] and
SPC/E water [30]. The starting FbFP structures were from x-ray
crystallography (WT) or the FoldX calculations (mutants). All
residues were assumed to be in their standard ionization states at
pH 7.0. The proteins were solvated by adding 10.0 Å SPC/E
water in a rhombic dodecahedron box and counter ions were used
to neutralize the systems. Before free energy calculations, 1000
steps energy minimizations followed by 1 ns MD simulations at
constant pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K) were
performed to equilibrate the systems. The pressure was regulated
using the extended ensemble Parrinello-Rahman approach
[31,32] and the temperature was controlled by a modified
Berendson thermostat [33]. The Particle-Mesh-Ewald Method
[34,35] was used to evaluate the contributions of the long-range
electrostatic interactions. A nonbonded pair list cutoff of 10.0 Å
was used and the nonbonded pair list was updated every 5 steps.
All bonds to hydrogen atoms in proteins were constrained by using
the LINC [36] algorithm whereas bonds and angles of water
molecules were constrained by SETTLE [37] algorithm, allowing
a time step of 0.002 ps.
The folding free energy difference between two mutants X and
Y was calculated from the difference of the free energies between
the folded and unfolded simulations. Instead of directly calculating
the folding free energies DG1 and DG2 for mutants X and Y, a
thermodynamic cycle was built (Figure S2A) so that DG3 and DG4,
corresponding to the free energy changes of mutating X to Y in
unfolded and folded states, were computed through an alchemical
process. Then the free energy difference DDG defined as
DG22DG1 can be obtained by DG42DG3, with a negative value
indicating mutant Y is more stable than X and a positive value
meaning X is more stable. It has been shown that for large
mutations, direct transformation from X to Y (e.g. WRR) is
challenging [19] and it becomes difficult to extract reliable free
energy values. In this work, an intermediate state was built
corresponding to a pseudo alanine residue (state I in Figure S2B),
with the Cb atom type (zero charge) defined as CH1 instead of
CH3 as in alanine in the Gromos53A6 force field. The
transformation from X to Y was separated into two steps, XRI
and YRI, and the free energy difference of the two steps is the
XRY transformation free energy. The X (or Y)RI free energy
change was calculated by the computational alchemy method [38–
41], which is briefly described here. Taking XRI alchemy as an
example, a l dependent Hamiltonian H(l) was introduced, with l
ranging from 0 to 1, H(0) = H(X) and H(1) = H(I). Since the only
difference between the X state and the I state is the extra side
chain atoms of residue X (except for alanine which has the same
number of atoms as the I state), the computational alchemy
corresponds to the annihilation of these atoms up to Cb. A path
was built to remove the side chain atom charges first followed by
the van der Waals parameters elimination. The side chain charges
were removed using linear l transformation with 21 windows and
l set at 0.05n (n = 0, 1, …20). Then the van der Waals (VDW)
interaction was eliminated using a soft core Lennard-Jones
potential which converts the side chain atom types to dummy
atoms [42], with a= 0.5, s= 0.3, and a soft-core power of 1.
These dummy atoms have the VDW radius and the depth of
VDW potential well, as well as bonded parameter equal to zero.
As a result, in the VDW transformation the bonded interactions
with the side chain atoms (up to Cb) of residue X were also
removed. Forty-one windows were used for the VDW transfor-
mation, with l equal to 0.025n (n = 0, 1, …40). Each window was
run for 250 ps, and the last 200 ps data were used for free energy
evaluation which was done using Bennett’s acceptance ratio
method [43]. Since X was mutated to I simultaneously in both
subunits, the computed electrostatic and VDW free energies were
scaled by 0.5. The total free energy change of the XRI alchemical
Author Summary
The bacterial blue-light photoreceptor YtvA from Bacillus
subtilis, which fluoresces in the presence or absence of
oxygen, provides new opportunities to study oxygen-
limited cellular systems. However its thermostability is
poor, hindering its applicability in thermophilic systems. In
this work, we develop an iterative combined computa-
tional and experimental method to significantly improve
this protein’s thermostability. The method is simple and
effective, which in principle can be applied to other
protein systems, thus adds a new tool to the protein
engineering arsenal.

transformationDG(XRI) =DGele(XRI)+DGvdw(XRI), whereDGele(XRI),
DGvdw(XRI) are free energy changes corresponding to Coulomb
switching and VDW switching respectively. The same relationship
applies for the YRI transformation. The free energy change of
the XRY transformation, DG4 =DGele(XRY)+DGvdw(XRY) =
(DGele(XRI)2DGele(YRI))+(DGvdw(XRI)2DGvdw(YRI)). The error for
each term was estimated as follows. We divided the 200 ps simulation
data to five blocks and calculated the standard deviation of
corresponding DG values (the free energy difference between two
neighboring windows). We used the standard deviation as the
estimation for the error of DG. The typical average correlation time
for DH (the Hamiltonian difference between two neighboring
windows) is about 3 ps (Figure S4), comparable to the value from
the literature [44], suggesting the data from five blocks are
independent in the simulation time span. However, longer correlation
time that is not sampled well in the simulation may still contribute to
the error of DG. When comparing the computed DG with the
experimental value, one has to bear in mind that this error can be a
source of the discrepancy.
Unlike the folded state, which has a well-defined structure, the
unfolded state is difficult to model. It has been proposed to use a GXG
tripeptide to mimic the unfolded state where X is the residue intended
for mutation. This simple model yields reasonable results compared to
the experimental DDG values [19] and thus was adopted in this work.
Similar to the folded state, the two step transformations were used to
calculate the free energies and the same MD simulation protocol was
employed for the GXG model. The free energy difference DG3
between the unfolded X and Y mutants can be calculated with the
equation similar to that for DG4 as described above. The folding
free energy change DDG(XRY) =DG42DG3 =DDGele(XRY)+
DDGvdw(XRY) = (DGele(XRY, F)2DGele(XRY, U))+(DGvdw(XRY, F)2
DGvdw(XRY, U)), where subscript F (U) stands for the folded (unfolded)
state. DDGele(XRY) and DDGvdw(XRY) are the electrostatics and VDW
contributions to the folding free energy differences between X and
Y mutants. The error of DDG(XRY) is propagated from that of DG.
It is worth noting that DDGele(XRY) and DDGvdw(XRY) depend on
the path selected for the free energy integration thus are not
uniquely defined. But the free energy decomposition provides
valuable information which cannot be obtained by DDG(XRY) alone
[45–47].
Sequence alignment analysis
Bacillus Subtilis FbFP was used as the initial target for sequence
search in NCBI nonredundant protein database. Sequences were
aligned using BLAST [48] and those with identity higher than
90% were excluded. A total of 83 sequences were collected and all
have identity higher than 45% with Bacillus Subtilis FbFP. The
frequency of one amino acid type at a specific site was defined as
the total number of the occurrence of the amino acid at this site
divided by 83, the total number of sequences.
Cloning, expression and purification
The DNA encoding residues 20–147 of FbFP and a His tag at
the C-terminus was ligated with the vector pET-30a digested with
the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixture was trans-
formed into an E. coli strain DH10B. The correct coding sequence
of the cloned fbfp gene was verified by DNA sequencing. The
expression construct (pET-30a-fbfp) was then transformed into E.
coli strain BL21 (DE3). All the mutations were made by PCR-
based site-directed mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing.
All the mutants were expressed and purified in a similar way.
Briefly, 250 mL of LB medium containing 50 mg/mL kanamycin
was inoculated with a fresh colony of expression strain BL21 (DE3)
containing pET-30a-fbfp. The culture was grown at 37uC with
vigorous shaking (,200 rpm). When the OD600 of the culture
reached 0.8, the expression of YtvA LOV was induced by the
addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture
was then grown for an additional 4 h. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation, washed twice with water, resuspended in 20 mL of
5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and 20 mMTris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.9), and disintegrated by three passes through a French
press. The disintegrated cells were centrifuged (9600 g, 4uC,
20 min) and the resulting supernatants were purified by Ni-NTA
affinity chromatography (Novagen) to homogeneity as determined
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford
protein assay [49].
Fluorescence measurements and data analysis
The decrease of FMN fluorescence when heating FbFP to a
higher temperature allows one to monitor protein folding and
unfolding by fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure S3). By setting the
excitation wavelength at 450 nm (maximum absorption frequency
at room temperature [24]), the maximum change of fluorescence
on thermal denaturation was obtained with an emission
wavelength of 506 nm (Figure S3). The final protein concentration
was 4.2 mM of monomer. Spectroscopic measurements were
carried out in a thermostated cuvette holder and the temperature
was gradually increased. For each data point at different
temperature, a delay of 10 min was applied before performing
fluorescence measurement to allow the full equilibration between
folded and unfolded states. The errors were estimated based on
duplicated measurements. The thermal denaturation of FbFP is
reversible based on the observation that heating the protein to a
higher temperature (e.g. 70uC) attenuates the fluorescence by
more than 80%, but it is fully recovered when the protein is cooled
to room temperature. The Gibbs free energy of unfolding at a
specific temperature T is written as [50],
DGU (T)~DH(Tm) 1{
T
Tm
 
z
DCp T{TmzT ln
T
Tm
 
{RTm ln Ct
ð1Þ
where Tm is the melting temperature (half of the protein
population is unfolded), DH is the unfolding enthalpy at Tm.
DCp is the difference of heat capacity in the folded and unfolded
state which is assumed to be temperature independent. Ct is the
total protein monomer concentration. This equation shows that
the Gibbs free energy as well as the melting temperature is related
to the protein concentration [50]. Thus, in this work for different
mutants, the same concentration (4.2 mM) was used to eliminate
this effect. The fluorescence intensity (IF) at specific temperature
can be expressed as [51],
IF (T)~

where aF (aU) is the fluorescence of the folded (unfolded) state at
zero K, and bF (bU) is the slope of the corresponding temperature
dependence. Incorporating eq. 1 to 2 shows there are a total of
seven parameters (DH, Tm, DCp, aF, aU, bF, bU) to be fitted to
experimental fluorescence intensities. A simpler five-parameter
model was also tested (DH, Tm, DCp, aF, aU, bF = bU = 0). Before
data fitting, fluorescence intensities were scaled so that the
maximum value was equal to 100. The fitting for FbFP using
seven parameters yielded a reduced x2 of 14.7 while fitting to the
A More Thermostable YtvA LOV Domain

five-parameter model gave x2 of 17.9, from which an F statistic
value of 1.31 was obtained. This number was smaller than the
critical F(2,12) value of 3.88 (a= 0.05), indicating the complex
seven-parameter model did not yield a significantly better fit. For
all other mutants, the five-parameter model fittings also produced
satisfactory results, and thus were selected for all fluorescence data
analysis throughout this work. By adding random Gaussian
distributed noise to the experimental data (with the standard
deviation equal to the fluorescence measurement error), 100
synthetic data sets were created and fitted to estimate the errors of
the fitting parameters. All the fittings were performed using an in-
house script. The results show that DCp and DH have a
considerable error derived from Gaussian noise (Table S1), but
the error of DG is much smaller, with an average of 0.14 kcal/mol
for all single mutants (Table 1). It is known that the DCp parameter
is difficult to determine with the fitting of protein thermal
denaturation fluorescence curve. Apparently the errors of DH
and DCp cancel out each other. Thus, DG can be determined with
accuracy higher than DH and DCp.
Results/Discussion
Computational screening
Starting from the crystal structure (pdb code: 2PR5), 2394 single
mutants (126619, saturation mutagenesis) were built and quickly
screened by FoldX, which predicted 712 mutants from 94 sites
have improved thermostability. Because it is very time consuming
to do free energy calculations for all the mutants, the number of
mutants was reduced to 103 using the following criteria: 1). For
each site, if several mutations show improved thermostability, only
the ones with relatively larger DDG are selected. 2). For mutations
involving charged residues, only those on surface that may form
salt bridges are selected. Free energy calculations suggest that 70 of
103 mutants are more stable than the wild type (WT) FbFP,
among which 40 mutants from 22 sites have DDG more negative
than 21 kcal/mol. The distribution of the 22 sites is shown in
Figure S1.
Experimental validation
Thirteen mutants that have relatively more negative DDG were
tested experimentally, including V25I, T30M, A33Y, T50M,
T54Y, A81M, V88L, V90I, L106M, N107F, D109E, V120I, and
N124F. Melting temperatures of the wild-type (WT) and mutants
were determined (see Materials and Methods) and are listed in
Table 2. The WT FbFP has a Tm of 42.8uC, indicating a moderate
thermostability. The temperature fluorescence plot suggests at
37uC, 25% of fluorescence is already lost compared to that of
14uC which is the starting temperature of measurements (Figure 1).
Eight of the tested mutants displayed improved stability (Table 2),
whereas four mutants are less stable and one mutant L106M loses
fluorescence at room temperature, presumably because L106
points to the active site and the mutant might perturb the FMN
binding pocket. The success rate of 62% is encouraging,
highlighting effectiveness of the computational screening. Loca-
tions of the eight thermostable sites with higher Tm are shown in
Figure 2. As can be seen, five sites are from the dimeric interface
including V25, N107, D109, V120 and N124, suggesting that
forging stronger interactions between subunits is an effective way
to increase FbFP thermostability.
Among the tested mutants, V120I has the highest Tm (54.2uC),
11.4uC higher than that of the WT. It is surprising that mutating a
valine to an isoleucine, equivalent to substituting one Hb atom
with a methyl group, has such a dramatic effect. In the free energy
calculation, the force field GROMOS53A6 was used where the
side chain charges are zero for these two residues. So the
stabilization of the methyl substitution is exclusively from the van
der Waals interaction (Table 1). The analysis of V120I MD
trajectory suggests that in subunit one this methyl is in contact with
V279 and I299 while in subunit two it contacts I299, I29 and M111

(prime denotes residues from the neighboring subunit, Figure 3A
and B, table S2). The contact differences in two subunits reflect the
asymmetry of the dimer.
N107F and N124F have second (50.9uC) and third (50.2uC)
highest Tm among the thirteen mutants. The free energy
calculation suggests that the stabilization of the mutants is mainly
from stronger van der Waals interaction (Table 1). It is worth
noting that the free energy decomposition to the electrostatics and
van der Waals is only an approximate process [46,52,53]. In this
work, we decompose the free energy to two components, the free
energy change of Coulomb switching and that of VDW switching,
slightly different from the literature. Though the decomposition is
exact, the values depend on the integration path and the process
should only be considered as a qualitative analysis. However it can
be linked to the structure and interaction more easily, thus
provides important insight about the enthalpic part of the free
energy. The MD simulation of the WT shows that N124 from
subunit 1 is in contact with R249 and V25, whereas N124 from
subunit two is in contact with V239, V25 and E105. In the mutant
N124F, F124 forms much more contacts than WT N124 in both
subunits (Figure 3C and D, Table S2). But for N107F, the
difference is less dramatic. Free energy calculations indicate van
der Waals contributes more than the electrostatics to DDGs for all
stabilizing mutants except D109E, revealing the importance of
enhancing core packing to protein stability. The carboxyl group of
D109 forms a hydrogen bond as an acceptor with the phenol
group of Y1419. Mutating D109 to a glutamic acid extends the
side chain and an extra hydrogen bond is formed with the N107
side chain amide (Table S3).
Rational design of more mutants
The high success rate of the stable interface mutants prompts us
to search for more candidates in the region. Most of the discovered
stabilizing mutants including V25I, N107F, D109E, V120I and
N124F are from the middle of the beta-strands that form the
interface. In searching for other stabilizing mutants, more effort
was put in interface regions away from the middle part because the
combination of mutants close to each other may not be additive.
Residues H22, M111 were identified. H22 was mutated to a lysine
to promote a potential salt bridge formation with E1059 or E1339,
or to a tryptophan to form more contacts. M111 was mutated to a
phenylalanine to increase this residue’s contacts with the
neighboring subunit. Free energy calculations demonstrate that
all three mutants have negative DDG values, suggesting they are
more stable than the WT. Inspection of the mutants N107F and
N124F MD snapshots implies it is possible to further stabilize the
protein by mutating F107 or F124 to a tyrosine to form more
favorable electrostatic interactions with the surroundings. This
observation is supported by the free energy calculations that
N107Y (N124Y) has a more negative DDG value than N107F

higher percentages of fluorescence at elevated temperature than WT

(N124F) and the difference is mainly from electrostatic interactions
(Table 1).
Five mutants H22K, H22W, M111F, N107Y and N124Y were
tested experimentally and the corresponding Tm values were listed
on Table 2. All five mutants were proved to be more stable,
consistent with the computational results, among which N124Y
has the highest Tm (63.8uC), 21.0uC higher than that of the WT.
The analysis of the N124Y MD trajectory suggests besides close
contacts with various residues (Table S2), N124Y forms extra
hydrogen bonds. Specifically, in subunit one the side chain
hydroxyl group of N124Y is h-bonded to V239 and V259, and in
subunit two it is h-bonded to V239 and Q129 (Table S3). These
hydrogen bonds are expected to contribute the most to the 13.6uC
Tm increase of the F to Y mutation. In comparison, N107Y is also
more stable than N107F but the difference is much smaller, only
,1uC. M111F has a Tm of 56.5uC, 13.7uC higher than the WT.
MD simulation suggests F111 in subunit one forms close contacts
with I29, I299, Y419, Y118 and V120, and in subunit two this
residue is in contact with I299, V409, Y419, Y118 and V120
(Figure 3G and H, table S2). H22K and H22W have Tm values
3uC and 7uC higher than the WT respectively. MD trajectory
shows K22 forms salt bridges (Table S4), and W22 forms several
contacts with the surroundings (Table S2).
Multiple mutations combination
About a dozen mutants have Tm higher than that of the WT,
providing an opportunity to improve the thermostability of the
protein further by combining multiple mutations. But there are
many ways of combining them. Two factors were considered, the
DTm (melting temperature difference with the WT) and the
distance between different mutants. Several multiple mutants were
tested, among which double mutant N107Y-N124Y displays better
thermostability than both N107Y and N124Y, and triple mutant
N107Y-N124Y-M111F has its Tm higher than all three single
mutants (Table 2). However, not all the multiple mutants have
higher thermostability than the single or double mutant. For
example, N107Y-N124Y-H22W has a Tm value 2uC lower than
that of N107Y-N124Y, though H22W has a Tm 7uC higher than
that of the WT. Similarly, N107Y mutation increases the Tm by
9uC, but N107Y-V120I is only marginally more stable than V120I
(Table 2). So the additivity of the thermostability seemly holds true
only for certain multiple mutants. N107Y-N124Y-M111F is the
mutant with the highest Tm presented in this work, which is 31uC
higher than that of the WT. To ensure that the triple mutations do
not compromise the fluorescence brightness of the protein, its
fluorescence quantum yield was determined, QF = 0.38, compara-
ble to that of the WT FbFP 0.39 [22].
Performance of the computational methods
FoldX method provides a quick way to evaluate the mutational
effect on the protein stability. It takes about 82 hours to screen
the amino acids at each site for FbFP (,2400 mutations) in a dual
processor (2.9 GHz Intel) computer. In this work, FoldX predicts
the thermostability of twelve out of seventeen mutants correctly,
suggesting that overall FoldX is effective in identifying stable
mutants. Three mutants, T50M, A81M and V88L, which are less
stable than WT, were not predicted correctly. Furthermore,
H22W and M111F were predicted less stable than the WT with
the DDG of 0.40 and 4.25 kcal/mol respectively but the
experimental DDGs are 21.16 and 22.87 kcal/mol. Further
inspection suggests that steric clashes exist for the M111F mutant
with its surroundings. By using the last MD snapshot of the 1 ns
NPT M111F simulation as the FoldX input, a DDG of
20.70 kcal/mol was obtained indicating M111F is more stable.
For mutations causing steric clashes, it has been recommended to
either soften the VDW repulsion [16] or relax the backbone
atoms slightly [15] which is not allowed in FoldX. The
correlation between the FoldX predicted and experimental
DDG is shown in Figure 4A. A Pearson correlation coefficient
RP of 0.19 was obtained, suggesting that FoldX only provides
qualitative information of the relative thermostability. For
mutations at the same site, e.g. N107Y/F or N124Y/F, FoldX
also predicts the relative thermostability in the wrong trend. For
example, N124Y is significantly more stable than N124F but
FoldX predicts DDG of 22.68 kcal/mol for the former and
23.67 kcal/mol for the later.
Free energy calculations, derived from statistical mechanics,
offer a more rigorous way to estimate mutational effect on
thermostability but with a much slower speed. A single point
mutation of FbFP needs 440 processor (AMD 1.9 GHz) hours,
about 13,000 times slower than the FoldX approach. Thirteen
of seventeen mutants were predicted with the correct sign of
DDG, except T50M, A81M, V88L and V90I. The predicted
and experimental DDGs are shown in Figure 4B. Two mutants,
T30M and D109E, are apparent outliers. Excluding these two, a
correlation coefficient RP of 0.68 was obtained with the best

fitted line of DDG (predicted) = 0.59DDG (experimental)
21.80 kcal/mol. A negative intercept suggests that free energy
calculations systematically overestimate the stability of the
mutants, which may be caused by the force field error.
Excluding the two outliers T30M and D109E, the mean
absolute error is to 1.7 kcal/mol. Applying the linear correction
reduces the error to 0.93 kcal/mol, comparable to results in the
literature [19]. Compared to FoldX, the free energy method is
more accurate and yields semiquantitative results. But there is
still room for improvement.
There are a total of 13 stabilizing mutants from 10 sites
(Table 2). It is interesting to see that 7 of the 10 sites are from
the dimeric interface, except T30, A33 and T54. Unlike the
interface, mutants around these three residues have not been
thoroughly examined. In fact, about 2/3 of the 40 stabilizing
mutants predicted by the free energy method (Figure S1) are
not from the interface region among which about half of the
mutation sites have not been tested experimentally. More
effort will be spent to search for single mutants away from the
dimeric interface and tune computational methods for screen-
ing multiple mutants.
Consensus analysis
A multiple sequence alignment was carried out for a total of 83
FbFP sequences from the NCBI protein database. It is striking that
none of the 13 stable mutants discovered in this work have the
highest occurrence frequency (defined as the probability to have a
specific amino acid at a particular site) at the mutated site (Table
S5). For example, for residue 120, valine has the highest
occurrence frequency of 78.3% which is much larger than that
of isoleucine 15.7%, but V120I improves the thermostability by
11.4uC. In fact the majority of the stable mutants have the
occurrence frequency at mutated sites smaller than that of the
WT. This finding strongly suggests that FoldX and free energy
calculations explore very different sequence spaces from the
consensus analysis method.
Conclusion
In this work, we developed a protocol to engineer a more
thermostable FbFP. Firstly, FoldX followed by free energy
calculations are performed to identify stable single mutant
candidates. Secondly, mutants predicted with more negative
DDGs are selected for the experimental validation. For FbFP,
the majority of stable mutants are from the dimeric interface
which is a ‘‘hot spot’’ of the protein. Thirdly, more single mutants

tional DDG by using FoldX (panel A) and the free energy

Briefly, FoldX followed by FEC (free energy calculation) are used to
search for potential thermostable single mutants, from which a dozen
are selected for experimental tests. The distribution of thermostable
mutants is analyzed to identify the ‘‘hot spot’’. Then more mutants in
the ‘‘hot spot’’ are calculated by FEC and those predicted to be more
stable are tested by experiments. Finally all stabilizing mutants are
pooled together and multiple mutants are combined to further improve
the protein’s stability.

from the ‘‘hot spot’’ are selected and verified by free energy
calculations first and those with more negative DDGs are subject to
experimental tests. Finally, stable single mutants are combined to
further improve the protein thermostability. A flow chart of the
protocol is shown in Figure 5. Thirteen out of eighteen tested
FbFP single mutants are more stable than the WT. Most of the
stabilizing mutants form a better core packing. The best triple
mutant N107Y-N124Y-M111F increases the Tm by 31uC without
compromising the fluorescence quantum yield. The experimental
test is by no means extensive but the effectiveness of the protocol
has been demonstrated. The combined experimental and compu-
tational method adopted in our work adds a new tool to enhance
protein thermostability, which can be extremely useful when
conventional methods (e.g. directed evolution) fail.
