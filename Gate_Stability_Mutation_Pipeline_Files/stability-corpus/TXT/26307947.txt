BARD1–BRCA1 complex plays an important role in DNA damage repair, apoptosis, chromatin remodeling, and other
important processes required for cell survival. BRCA1 and BARD1 heterodimer possess E3 ligase activity and is
involved in genome maintenance, by functioning in surveillance for DNA damage, thereby regulating multiple pathways
including tumor suppression. BRCT domains are evolutionary conserved domains present in different proteins such as
BRCA1, BARD1, XRCC, and MDC1 regulating damage response and cell-cycle control through protein–protein interac-
tions. Nonetheless, the role of BARD1BRCT in the recruitment of DNA repair mechanism and structural integrity with
BRCA1 complex is still implicit. To explicate the role of BARD1BRCT in the DNA repair mechanism, in silico,
in vitro, and biophysical approach were applied to characterize BARD1 BRCT wild-type and Arg658Cys and Ile738Val
mutants. However, no drastic secondary and tertiary structural changes in the mutant proteins were observed. Thermal
and chemical denaturation studies revealed that mutants Arg658Cys and Ile738Val have a decrease in Tm and ΔG than
the wild type. In silico studies of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) and mutant protein indicate loss in structural compactness
on the Ile738Val mutant. Comparative studies of wild-type and mutants will thus be helpful in understanding the basic
role of BARD1BRCT in DNA damage repair.

1. Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the prominent causes for cancer
deaths in the developing countries. It has been found that
mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes can predis-
pose someone at the risk of developing breast and ovarian
cancer (Collins et al., 1995; Miki et al., 1994; Wooster
et al., 1994). The inherited germ line mutations in the
genes like RAD50, ATM, CHEK2, NBS1, 53BP1, PALB2,
BRIP1 BRCA 1/2, and BARD1 regulate genomic integri-
tyand cancer predisposing factors (Ahmed & Rahman,
2006; Heikkinen et al., 2006; Karppinen et al., 2006;
Meijers-Heijboer et al., 2002; Rapakko, Heikkinen,
Karppinen, Erkko, & Winqvist, 2007; Renwick et al.,
2006). BARD1 is a structurally correlated but sequen-
tially distinct protein from BRCA1. BARD1 and BRCA1
both harbor N-terminal RING domain and two C-terminal
tandem BRCT repeat motifs (Wu et al., 1996). BARD1
contains four ankyrin repeats in the region (425–550),
which is absent in BRCA1. BRCA1 and BARD1
heterodimerize by RING–RING domain interaction and
colocalize to distinct nuclear assemblies at different stages
of cell-cycle progression (Jin et al., 1997; Scully et al.,
1997). Furthermore, in vivo BRCA1–BARD1 heterodimer
forms active E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and plays a sig-
nificant role in tumor suppression (Brzovic, Meza,
King, & Klevit, 2001; Brzovic, Rajagopal, Hoyt, King, &
Klevit, 2001; Wu-Baer, Lagrazon, Yuan, & Baer, 2003).
Mis-sense mutations within the BRCA1 RING domain
lead to loss in heterodimerization which further reduces
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Brzovic, Meza, et al., 2001).
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) domain is conserved in many
other multiple DNA damage response (DDR) proteins
(Bork et al., 1997; Callebaut & Mornon, 1997).
Different DDR proteins have diverse repeats of
BRCTs (Mohammad & Yaffe, 2009). It has been reported
that BARD1 BRCT is required for the early recruitment
of BRCA1 at the DNA damage site (Li & Yu, 2013).
Noting the role of BARD1 in genomic integrity, we
decided to explore functional consequences of genetic
alterations discovered in the BARD1 BRCT region. Two
cancer predisposing mutations, Arg658Cys in Caucasian,
African, Finnish populations, and Ile738Val in Polish and

Belgian families have been detected (Alshatwi, Hasan,
Syed, Shafi, & Grace, 2012; Antoniou et al., 2010;
De Brakeleer et al., 2010; Karppinen, Heikkinen,
Rapakko, & Winqvist, 2004; Thai et al., 1998), but the
molecular mechanism of how these mutations of BARD1
gene lead to breast cancer has not been explored. Further,
in sporadic and BRCA1-associated breast cancers,
expression of BARD1 is observed to be too low suggest-
ing a significant role of BARD1 in breast carcinogenesis
(Ghimenti et al., 2002; Yoshikawa et al., 2000).
In this study, we have used in vitro experiments and
in silico approaches to understand the folding pattern of
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) and its two cancer-disposing
mutants, Arg658Cys and Ile738Val. Molecular dynamics
simulations (MDS) were carried out to explore alter-
ations in the structure at the atomic level. To our conclu-
sion, both the mutants show loss in thermodynamic
stability; however, BARD1 Ile738Val protein structure
shows higher structural flexibility.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Molecular dynamics simulation
The crystal structure of BARD1 BRCT (568-777)
wild-type protein was taken from PDB (pdb id: 2NTE),
(Birrane, Varma, Soni, & Ladias, 2007). BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) amino acid sequence was retrieved from the
Uniprot database (Accession ID: q99728). Point mutants,
Arg658Cys and Ile738Val, were introduced using SPDB
viewer (Kaplan & Littlejohn, 2001). MDS was per-
formed using GROMACS 4.5.5 package (Hess, Kutzner,
van der Spoel, & Lindahl, 2008) installed on a 80-node
cluster of Xeon quad-core processors. The molecular sys-
tems were solvated with TIP3P water molecules in a
cubic box with periodic boundary conditions of 1.0 nm
from the edge of the box. Counter ions were added to
neutralize the systems. The systems were subjected to
energy minimization for 5000 iterations by steepest des-
cent algorithm implementing under OPLS-AA force field
(Kaminski, Friesner, Tirado-Rives, & Jorgensen, 2001)
with a tolerance of 1000 kJ/mol/nm. Electrostatic, colum-
bic, and van der Waals interactions were calculated with
a distance cut-off of 1.4 nm. Systems were equilibrated
using NVT (Moles Volume Temperature) followed by
NPT (Moles Pressure Temperature) ensemble for 50,000
steps each. SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert, Ciccotti, &
Berendsen, 1977) was used to constrain bond lengths.
Finally, systems were subjected to MD simulation for
50 ns of production run with time-step integration of
2 fs. The trajectories were saved at every 2 ps and ana-
lyzed using GROMACS. The comparative analysis of
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and mutant
structures, Arg658Cys, Ile738 Val, were performed to
calculate the RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, solvent
accessible surface area (SASA), Dictionary of secondary
structure pattern (DSSP) (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), and
hydrogen-bond interactions.
2.2. Principal component analysis
Principal component (PC) was calculated using eigenvec-
tors and eigenvalues for the covariance matrix. Projection
of first two principal components was carried out by
essential dynamics method described within the
GROMACS package (Amadei, Linssen, & Berendsen,
1993). After removing the rotational and translational
movements, variance/covariance matrix was built and fur-
ther eigenvectors and eigenvalues were calculated. The
eigenvalues are representative of amplitude of eigenvec-
tors in multidimensional space. The concerted motion of
the protein can be detected by the displacement of atoms
along each eigenvector.
2.3. Protein expression and purification
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type protein was cloned in
pET-28a vector (cDNA of full-length BARD1 was kind
gift from Prof. Richard Bayer, Institute of Cancer Genet-
ics, Columbia University). Mismatch primer method of
site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the
Arg658Cys and Ile738Val mutants (forward primer Arg
658Cys 5′-GAAATTCCTGAAGGTCCATGCAGAAGC-
AGGCTCAACAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTGTTGAGCC-
TGCTTCTGCATGGACCTTCAGGAATTTC-3′, forward
primer Ile738Val 5′-CTGCACACAGTATATCGTCTAT-
GAAGATTTGTGT-3′ reverse primer 5′-ACACAAATC-
TTCATAGACGATATACTGTGTGCAG-3′). The BARD1
BRCT (568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738V
mutant proteins were expressed and purified in 6His
fusion proteins using Rosetta 2(DE3) bacterial cells.
Fusion proteins were first purified on Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography, then further treated with TEV to remove
the fusion tag. Protein was purified using AKTA FPLC
size exclusion chromatography on superdex 75 column
(GE Healthcare).
2.4. Dynamic light scattering experiment
Purified BARD1 BRCT (568-777), Arg658Cys, and
Ile738Val mutant proteins were analyzed on Malvern
particle size analyzer (Zetasizer μV) dynamic light scat-
tering instrument to characterize the oligomeric nature of
these proteins. The protein samples were filtered
(0.22-μm filter) and degassed prior to scanning. 1.0 mg/
ml of wild-type and mutant proteins were scanned at 5-
min intervals for 15 min, and effective diameters were
obtained from peak positions. The experiments were
repeated three times and the average was considered to
be the true value.

2.5. Circular dichroism spectroscopy
Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed using
different concentrations of purified proteins on the
JASCO-815 spectropolarimeter. For far–UV CD spectra,
the protein concentration was 10 μM and the wavelength
range was taken from λ = 200–240 nm, and for near-UV
spectra, the wavelength range was from λ = 350–250 nm
with the protein concentration of 40 μM (buffer: 2.5 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl). Blank-corrected seven
independent data scans were averaged, and the average
value is presented for further comparative structural
analysis. Furthermore, proteins at a concentration of
10 μM were unfolded in a temperature range from 10 to
65°C, and folding pattern was monitored by measuring
ellipticity at λ = 222 nm. Near-UV range, thermal denat-
uration studies were performed for 40 μM of proteins at
different temperatures 20, 30, 45, and 60°C. The observed
values of fractions unfolded were used for curve fitting.
2.6. Limited proteolysis
BARD1 BRCT wild-type and mutant proteins (2 mg/ml)
were treated with trypsin (37°C) and chymotrypsin
(25°C), 10 ρg/μl each in the digestion cocktail. At the
time points of 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, the
reaction was stopped by adding protease inhibitor PMSF
(1 mM). The experiment was repeated thrice considering
untreated wild-type and mutant samples as controls.
2.7. Fluorescence spectroscopy
2.7.1. Chemical denaturation
Micro-environment of tryptophan residue in the proteins
were investigated using fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Horiba, USA).While the excitation was at λ = 295 nm,
the individual fluorescence emission spectra were
recorded from λ = 310–400 nm. In chemical denatura-
tion, BARD1 BRCT proteins (2 μM) were treated with
increasing concentrations of GuHCl (0–6 M) keeping the
final volume constant, and emission spectra were
recorded between λ = 310 and 400 nm. Averaged blank-
corrected data were analyzed by fitting to a three-state
transition model (Pace, 1986; Pace & Shaw, 2000;
Vikrant et al., 2013).
2.7.2. Data analysis and curve fitting
Thermodynamic parameters were determined during the
GuHcl unfolding process by detecting the folded (N) to
intermediate (I) and intermediate to unfolded (U) transi-
tions of the curve. Further, thermodynamic constraints
analysis and curve fitting were performed (Pace & Shaw,
2000; Vikrant, Nakhwa, Badgujar, Kumar, & Rathore,
2014).
2.8. Chemical cross-linking assay
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and mutant proteins
were incubated with 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and the reac-
tion was terminated by addition of 5 µl of 1 M Tris
pH-8.0. Reaction was stopped in a time-dependent man-
ner (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively) and
analyzed on 12% SDS–PAGE. Untreated protein sample
was taken as control.
3. Results and discussion
Deleterious non-synonymous single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (nsSNPs) are involved in inducing disease-
associated phenomena, because of structural alterations
and consequent loss of molecular functions. The modern
bioinformatics-based advanced methods have now
enabled us to determine the structural effects due to
deleterious nsSNPs in the target candidate genes. In the
current study, multidisciplinary, in vitro, biophysical, and
in silico approaches were employed to understand the
pathogenicity of BARD1 BRCT, Arg658Cys, and
Ile738Val mutants (Figure 1(F)).
3.1. Folding pattern of BARD1 BRCT (568-777)
wild-type and mutants
BARD1 BRCT, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutations
have been discovered from the affected families of breast
and ovarian cancer. Considering the importance of muta-
tions in predisposing the cancer risk, we decided to
characterized abrogative effect of mutations on the struc-
ture and function of the protein. It has been well docu-
mented that different classes of proteins with exposed
hydrophobic residues become highly prone to non-speci-
fic interactions (Kolchanov, Soloviov, & Zharkikh, 1983;
Zhukov, Jaroszewski, & Bierzynski, 2000), which in turn
lead to the formation of high molecular weight aggre-
gates. The residual Arg658Cys mutation is the substitu-
tion of a basic amino acid to a small non-polar residue,
cysteine. However, Ile738Val substitution is a change
from a large to small hydrophobic residue. Ile to Val
mutation leads to removal of –CH2–group from Ile, and
potentially create a void volume of 25 Å3 in the mutant
protein (Harpaz, Gerstein, & Chothia, 1994). Such muta-
tions may lead to the loss of hydrophobic interactions
and van der Waals interactions among the substituted and
neighboring residues. To explore this prospect, we have
used gel filtration chromatography (AKTA FPLC, super-
dex 75 column) to probe the oligomeric status of the
mutants Arg658Cys and Ile738Val. The non-synonymous
amino acid substitution in protein tends to show differen-
tial solubility and elution profiles in gel filtration
chromatography. There was no substantial alteration in
solubility and elution profiles of Arg658Cys and

Ile738Val mutant. In size exclusion chromatography,
wild-type as well as mutants elute at the same position in
superdex 75 column (GE) (Figure 1(A) and (B)). Hence,
it is concluded that Arg658Cys and Ile 738Val mutations
are not affecting the monomeric nature of BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type protein in solution. This monomeric
behavior of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type,
Arg658Cys, and Ile 738Val mutant proteins were further
supported by chemical cross-linking experiments
(Supplementary Figure 1A). No higher molecular aggre-
gate formations were observed using cross-linking assay
of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and
Ile738Val proteins. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering
of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild- type, Arg658Cys, and

Ile738Val mutant samples also indicated their monomeric
nature. Albeit, BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild- type and
Arg658Cys did not show any change in hydrodynamic
size, a slight increment was observed in Ile738Val mutant
protein (Figure 1(E)). The hydrodynamic diameter of
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild- type and Arg658Cys pro-
teins were found to be 6.44 ± 0.45 nm, whereas Ile738Val
mutant protein showed a diameter of 7.40 ± .23 nm. The
relative increase in effective hydrodynamic size indicates
molecular expansion in Ile738Val mutant. Relative
increase in the hydrodynamic radii in Ile738Val mutant
may be due to the void volume generated in the
hydrophobic core of the protein. This may further
increase the conformational entropy of neighboring resi-
dues making mutant protein structurally more flexible
and leading to the increase in effective hydrodynamic
diameter of the protein.
3.2. Structural organization
Far-UV CD spectra show predominant α-helix and
β-strand characteristic, and no significant differences
were observed in the mean residual ellipticities of wild-
type and mutant proteins (Figure 1(C)). Near-UV CD
spectra were obtained to dissect the effect of mutations
on overall packing of the protein. Comparative near-UV
spectra of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type,
Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant proteins do not reveal
change in ellipticity, hence mutations are not abrogating
the tertiary structure of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-
type protein (Figure 1(D)). Treating with trypsin
(10 pg/mol) and chymotrypsin (10 pg/mol) for three
hours, the pattern on 12% SDS–PAGE for the wild-type
and both the mutant proteins was very similar (Figure 2).
This observation suggests that the mutants also have
compact tertiary structure similar to that of the wild-type
protein. However, wild-type and mutants were different
when treated with the chemical denaturant GuHCl.
To determine the unfolding pattern of BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant
proteins, all proteins with 2 μM concentration were incu-
bated with increasing concentrations of GuHCl (0–6 M)
for 24 h until equilibrium was achieved. Emission max-
ima were recorded between λ = 310 and 390 nm. In the
absence of GuHCl, while wild-type protein shows emis-
sion maximum at λ = 333 nm, the emission maxima for
BARD1 BRCT (568-777), Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val
mutant proteins were at λ = 336 and 337 nm, respec-
tively. This red shifting in the emission maximum for the
mutants is due to the local change in the environment,
resulting in exposure of buried tryptophan to polar
solvent interface. BARD1 BRCT wild-type and mutant
proteins denatured completely in 6 M GuHCl with an
emission maximum of λ = 345 nm, which indicates that
tryptophans are exposed to polar interface (Figure 3(A)).
Thus, collective observations from CD spectroscopy,

limited proteolysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy sug-
gested that Arg658Cys and Ile738Val substitutions might
be affecting secondary and tertiary structures only
locally, and the effect of mutation is collectively
responsible for tertiary structural alterations.
3.3. Thermodynamic stability of BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type and mutants
To evaluate unfolding phenomenon and thermodynamic
stability, thermal denaturation studies of proteins were
performed using CD spectroscopy. The change in ellip-
ticity due to gradual increase in the temperature from 10
to 65°C was recorded. Ellipticity at λ = 222 nm was used
to calculate fractions unfolded (Figure 4(A)). The data
obtained from CD at λ = 222 nm could fit satisfactorily
into a two-state denaturation model for wild-type and all
mutants (Pace, 1986; Pace & Shaw, 2000). The transition
mid-point (Tm) calculated for BARD1 BRCT (568-777)
wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant proteins
were 40.6, 41.7, and 47.8°C, respectively. The changes
in free energies corresponding to the denaturation were:
ΔG°H2O 9.6 ± 0.32, 7.3 ± 0.12, and 7.6 ± .42 kcal/mol,
respectively. For tertiary structure stability assessment,
near-UV CD spectra of BARD1 BRCT(568-777) wild-
type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant proteins were
monitored at four different temperatures: 10, 30, 45, and
60°C corresponding to λ = 280 and λ = 295. At the
temperature ranges from 10 to 30°C, BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val, peaks at
λ = 295 nm and λ = 280 nm were observed, which is
characteristic of well folded 3-D structures. Furthermore,
at 45°C, BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and Ile738-
Val mutant proteins show 40% loss in the mean residual
ellipticity, but a complete loss in ellipticity was observed
in Arg658Cys mutant. It is therefore concluded that
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and Ile738Val
mutant proteins have higher thermal stability than
Arg658Cys (Figure 4(B)–(D)). Fluorescence spec-
troscopy was used to monitor unfolding at 283 K
induced by GuHCl. For chemical denaturation of
BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and
Ile738Val mutant proteins, thermodynamic parameters
were calculated by plotting average fluorescence
emission wavelength against GuHcl concentration
(Figure 3(B)). ΔG° H2O for BARD1 BRCT, Arg658Cys,
and Ile738Val were 7.19 ± .36, 6.29 ± .41, and 6.8
± .21 kcal/mol, respectively. This value of the BARD1
BRCT wild-type protein is in agreement with the earlier
reported results (Thanassoulas et al., 2010). ΔG for
folded to intermediate and then from intermediate to
unfolded state for wild-type proteins was calculated to be
2.68 and 4.5 kcal/mol, for Ile738Val mutant to be 1.8
and 4.8658 kcal/mol, for Arg658Cys mutant to be 2.2
and 4.09 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the folded mutants
are thermodynamically less stable than the wild type.

3.4. MDS of BARD1 BRCT, ARG658CYS, and ILE
738VAL mutations
Molecular dynamics calculations were performed to
visualize the structural alterations in BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant
proteins. Cα, RMSD values from the input structure were
plotted against time (50 ns) (Figure 5(A)). It has been
observed that wild-type and mutant structures showed
similar deviations till 1500 ps, and at 1750 ps, the struc-
tures behaved differently. However, after 1.75 ns, Ile738-
Val mutant structure RMSD increases to about 3 Å,
whereas wild-type and Ile738Val structures remained
with a RMSD value of ~1.75 to 2 Å and ~1.75 to 3 Å,
respectively. In BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and
Arg658Cys and Ile738Val mutant protein structures, the
magnitude of Cα RMSD fluctuations, after relaxation
period produces stable trajectories throughout the simula-
tion (Figure 5(A)). The RMSF values of BARD1 BRCT
(568-777) wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant
protein structures were obtained, and higher degree of
residual flexibility were observed for Ile738Val mutant
protein (Figure 5(B)). The BARD1 BRCT (568-777)
wild-type structure showed radius of gyration (Rg) value
of ∼1.924 nm at 0 ns, ∼1.946 nm at 2 ns, ∼1.92 nm at
5 ns, ∼1.94 nm at 10 ns, ∼1.97 nm at 15 ns, ∼1.93 nm at
20 ns, ∼1.96 nm at 25 ns, and 1.95 nm at 30 ns. Ile738-
Val mutant structure showed Rg value of ∼1.92 nm at
0 ns, ∼1.954 nm at 2 ns, ∼1.97 nm at 5 ns, ∼1.94 nm at
10 ns, ∼1.95 nm at 15 ns, ∼1.92 nm at 20 ns, ∼1.91 nm
at 25 ns, and 1.94 nm at 30 ns. Arg658Cys mutant struc-
ture showed Rg value of ∼1.925 nm at 0 ns, ∼1.94 nm at
2 ns, ∼1.95 nm at 5 ns, ∼1.94 nm at 10 ns, ∼1.95 nm at
15 ns, ∼1.93 nm at 20 ns, and ∼1.93 nm at 25 ns, and
1.94 nm at 30 ns. Radius of gyration of Arg658Cys
mutant protein structure does not show much fluctuation,
but Ile738Val mutant protein structure shows great varia-
tion throughout 50 ns simulation. Random change in
radius of gyration at 20 ns of Ile738Val mutant protein

structure indicates that structure has lost rigidity
(Figure 5(D)). BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type and
Arg658Cys mutant protein structures do not show any
drastic change in the SASA values, in sharp contrast to
Ile738Val mutant protein, which shows increase in the
solvent accessible surface area during the initial phase of
the simulation (Figure 5(E)). We have also observed sig-
nificant differences in the hydrogen bonding pattern dur-
ing the simulation. BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-type
protein has shown better retention in hydrogen bonds
over the period of stimulation compared to Ile738Val
and Arg658Cys mutant protein structures (Figure 5(C)).
Hydrogen bond sampling at every 10 ns further indicated
that wild-type protein shows higher retention of hydrogen
bond than the mutant proteins (Supplementary Figure 3).
Loss of hydrogen bond formation leads to more flexible
conformation, and might result in loss of function of the
mutant protein.
To understand the overall dynamics and evaluate the
degree of flexibility, we have performed PCA and plotted
eigenvector 1 v/s eigenvector 2 (Figure 6(B)–(D)). The
area spanned/dispersion by this plot is indicative of the
nature of motion. It has been observed that BARD1
BRCT (568-777) wild-type protein has the compact
structure. Mutant Ile738Val is more flexible than BARD1
BRCT (568-777) wild-type and Arg658Cys proteins
(Figure 6(A)). The DSSP plug-in of GROMACS moni-
tored the secondary structures at different times during
simulation (Kabsch & Sander, 1983). BARD1 BRCT
Ile738Val mutant started losing the α-helix occurring
between 50th and 60th residues and lost completely at
about 25 ns (Figure 7(A) and (B)). However, no drastic

change in the secondary structure of wild-type and
Arg658Cys mutant were observed (Figure 7(C)). It can
be concluded that loss in α helical content in Ile738Val
mutant protein may lead to structural flexibility.
This was further supported by the change in volume
recorded in DLS and fluorescence spectroscopic studies
(Figure 5(F)).
3.5. Weak intramolecular interactions
Minimum energy structures of BARD1 BRCT (568-777)
wild-type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant proteins
were used to study the weak intramolecular interactions.
In the wild-type structure, Arg 658 forms hydrogen bond
with the Glu 652, 649, and 655, and non-covalent
interactions with Ser 660, Gly 656, Leu 662, and Arg
661. In Cys 658 mutant structure, there is a reduction in
the number of hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, Cys 658
forms non-covalent interactions with Gly 656, Glu 652,
Pro 654, Ile 653, and Ser 660 (Supplementary Fig-
ure 2 (A) and (B)). Mutant Ile738Val is involved in the
hydrogen bonding with the Tyr 678 and non-hydrogen
bonding interaction with Tyr 736, Phe 736, and Ala 758.
Furthermore, Val 738 forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr
678 and a new hydrogen bond is established with
Trp680 and non-hydrogen bonding interactions with Phe
683, Leu 679, Phe 677, Ala 758, and Tyr 736. Mutant
structure Arg658Cys comprehensively loses the hydro-
gen bonds as compared to wild-type structure, further
destabilizing the structure and surface charge of the pro-
tein molecule (Supplementary Figure 2 (C) and (D)).
4. Conclusions
To explore the structural effect of Arg658Cys and
Ile738Val mutations on BARD1 BRCT, we have carried
out biophysical experiments and MD simulations. In the
crystal structure of BARD1 BRCT, Arg658 is a surface
exposed residue, whereas Ile 738 is buried inside the
structure. Expression and purification profile of BARD1
BRCT wild-type and mutant proteins do not show any
drastic change in solubility and monomeric behavior.
Secondary structures characterized by CD spectroscopy
suggest that mutation is not inducing immense global
changes, as the change in the ellipticity values is almost
identical for all proteins. Far-UV spectra of proteins
show insignificant change in the secondary structure, but
slight local changes in the structure are also irrefutable.
Near-UV CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy,
and limited proteolysis experiments suggested that the
mutations are not affecting the overall compactness. The
Tm value has reduced by 7 and 6.2°C for the mutants.
Interestingly, the same concentration of GuHCl appears
to be required to denature the wild-type and mutant
proteins. Results from molecular dynamics simulation
indicated that Ile738Val structure has gain flexibility
compared to wild-type and Arg658Cys mutant proteins.
The gain of flexibility has been detected in RMSD,
RMSF, and Rg plot for Ile738Val mutant, which is fur-
ther supported by red shift in native fluorescence maxi-
mum, decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds,
increase in volume, SASA, and PCA. Loss of Tm and
ΔG of BARD1 BRCT and Arg658Cys and Ile738Val
mutants with respect to wild-type suggests that substitu-
tions are physiologically detrimental. It has been
observed collectively that wild-type and mutant proteins
exhibited analogous secondary structural constituents,
whereas fluorescence spectroscopy suggested that the
comparative positioning of Trp and Tyr were signifi-
cantly hindered. MDS of BARD1 BRCT (568-777) wild-
type, Arg658Cys, and Ile738Val mutant protein structures
has been comprehensively analyzed to understand the
structural alterations. Our results from the biophysical,
in vitro, and in silico approaches predict that Arg658Cys
and Ile738Val mutants are destabilizing the BARD1
BRCT domain which may lead to the loss of thermody-
namic stability and functional activity.
