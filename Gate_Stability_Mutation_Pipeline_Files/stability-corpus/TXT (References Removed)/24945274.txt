Abstract
The [Het-s] prion of the fungus Podospora anserina represents a good model system for studying the structure-function
relationship in amyloid proteins because a high resolution solid-state NMR structure of the amyloid prion form of the HET-s
prion forming domain (PFD) is available. The HET-s PFD adopts a specific b-solenoid fold with two rungs of b-strands
delimiting a triangular hydrophobic core. A C-terminal loop folds back onto the rigid core region and forms a more dynamic
semi-hydrophobic pocket extending the hydrophobic core. Herein, an alanine scanning mutagenesis of the HET-s PFD was
conducted. Different structural elements identified in the prion fold such as the triangular hydrophobic core, the salt
bridges, the asparagines ladders and the C-terminal loop were altered and the effect of these mutations on prion function,
fibril structure and stability was assayed. Prion activity and structure were found to be very robust; only a few key mutations
were able to corrupt structure and function. While some mutations strongly destabilize the fold, many substitutions in fact
increase stability of the fold. This increase in structural stability did not influence prion formation propensity in vivo.
However, if an Ala replacement did alter the structure of the core or did influence the shape of the denaturation curve, the
corresponding variant showed a decreased prion efficacy. It is also the finding that in addition to the structural elements of
the rigid core region, the aromatic residues in the C-terminal semi-hydrophobic pocket are critical for prion propagation.
Mutations in the latter region either positively or negatively affected prion formation. We thus identify a region that
modulates prion formation although it is not part of the rigid cross-b core, an observation that might be relevant to other
amyloid models.

Introduction
Amyloids are protein aggregates with a cross-b structure.
Amyloid folds are gradually being recognized as important
components in the structural landscape of peptides and proteins.
The amyloid fold has been envisioned as a generic primordial fold
from which globular folds had to emancipate in prebiotic times to
attain structural and functional diversification into globular
proteins [1,2,3,4,5]. Amyloid folds also fulfill a variety of biological
functions in relation to their specific structural properties [2,6,7].
Importantly, amyloids represent the underlying cause of a number
of age-related protein deposition diseases which impose a major
burden to modern societies [8,9]. Yet, the determinants that
govern amyloid folding and stability are much less well understood
than in the case of globular proteins in part because of the scarcity
of available high resolution structures of amyloid proteins.
Amyloids have the inherent property of being self-perpetuating
and as such can represent the mechanistic basis for prion
formation [10,11,12,13]. Many prions are amyloids that are self-
perpetuating in vivo. Amyloid prions cause fatal neurodegenerative
diseases in mammals and can be encountered as epigenetic
elements in fungi [14,15]. The [Het-s] prion of the filamentous
fungus Podospora anserina represents an example of such fungal
prions [16,17,18]. Highly prevalent in nature, [Het-s] is involved
in a non-self recognition process that takes place when cells of
unlike genotype undergo fusion [16,19]. This process termed
heterokaryon incompatibility leads to the cell death of the mixed
fusion cells. The het-s gene exists as two incompatible alleles
termed het-s and het-S. When a het-s and a het-S strain are
confronted, the incompatibility cell death response leads to the
formation of a macroscopic demarcation line termed barrage. It is
proposed that this cell death reaction might have a more general
function in fungal defense [20,21,22]. Strains of the het-s genotype
exist as two alternate epigenetic states: [Het-s*] (the non-prion-
state) and [Het-s] (the prion state). Transition to the prion state
can occur spontaneously at a low rate or can be induced
systematically by contact with a prion-infected ([Het-s]) strain.
The prion form then invades the fungal hyphal network at a rate
an order of magnitude higher than the linear growth rate of the
fungus [23]. Incompatibility is only triggered when HET-s is in the

prion form ([Het-s]). Thus in this system, the prion state
corresponds to the active state of the protein. The [Het-s] prion
also displays a specific effect in the sexual cycle, where presence of
the prion form leads to specific abortion of the het-S spores in a
sexual cross, a process designated spore-killing [24].
The HET-s protein displays two distinct domains, an N-
terminal globular domain termed HeLo and a C-terminal prion
forming domain [25,26]. The PFD encompassing residues 218 to
289 is natively unfolded in the soluble form of the proteins and
adopts a specific b-solenoid fold in the amyloid prion form of the
protein [25,27,28,29]. Cell death is triggered when [Het-s]
interacts with HET-S because the HET-s PFD templates the
folding of the homologous region of HET-S into the b-solenoid
fold which in turn induces a refolding of the globular domain and
exposition of a N-terminal hydrophobic helix which targets the cell
membrane [30,31,32]. A second mode of activation of HET-S,
apparently involves the NWD2 STAND protein encoded by the
gene adjacent to HET-S which contains an N-terminal region
homologous to the PFD region [21,33].
A high-resolution solid state NMR structure of the amyloid
form of the HET-s PFD (HET-s(218–289) based on more than
2500 distance constraints has been reported [28,29]. This domain
adopts a b-solenoid fold in which b-strands delimit a triangular
hydrophobic core. The domain is composed of two 21 amino acid
long pseudo-repeats each of which forms one layer of b-strand in
the b-solenoid structure, the two repeats are connected by a 15
amino acid long flexible loop. At the C-terminus of the domain, a
C-terminal loop folds back onto the core region and forms a semi-
hydrophobic pocket which can be considered as an extension of
the hydrophobic core [28], (Figure 1A). The b-solenoid fold
contains two aspargine ladders at the beginning of the first and last
b-strand of each repeat and three salt bridges per monomer. The
hydrophobic core contains essentially aliphatic residues and serine
and threonine residues residing in different b-strand layers and
forming a hydrogen bond within the core. A 8.5 Å cryo-EM
model of HET-s(218–289) fibrils has also been reported and
largely agrees with the ssNMR data. HET-s(218–289) are singlet
fibrils with a left-handed twist and a helical pitch of 410 Å [34].
Sequence comparisons suggest an evolutionary conservation of
the b-solenoid fold [35,36]. Characterization of a HET-S homolog
of a different fungal species, the plant pathogen Fusarium
graminearum revealed a conservation of the b-solenoid fold and of
the prion formation ability [37,38]. Thus, the HET-s PFD
sequence has been evolutionarily shaped to adopt this fold and
the overall fold and the prion forming ability have been conserved
over an extended evolutionary period. Perhaps, as a consequence
of this evolutionary process, the HET-s PFD sequence does not to
lead to the formation of amyloid polymorphs in physiological
conditions as generally observed for disease causing amyloids or
for yeast prions [13,39]. HET-s(218–289) adopts the same
structure in vitro and when forming inclusion bodies during
heterologous expression in E. coli [40]. Only at highly acidic pH,
when the native b-solenoid fold cannot be attained, HET-s(218–
289) adopts an alternate non-infectious amyloid structure
[34,41,42,43,44]. Alanine scanning approaches have been widely
used to analyze folding and stability of globular proteins and such
approaches have also been used in the context of amyloid fibril
formation and stability [45,46]. In the case of yeast prion proteins
such as the well studied Sup35 model, the applicability of such
approaches is complicated by the absence of a full structure model,
the primary sequence independence in prion formation and the
existence of multiple prion strains corresponding to different
amyloid polymorphs [47,48,49]. Nevertheless, a recent study has
revealed the importance of a glycine pair in [PSI+] prion formation
as a structural determinant in the soluble form of the PFD [50].
The HET-s model constitutes a favorable system for such studies
because of the lack of prion strain variants and the availability of a
high resolution structure. A previous study has revealed the
functional importance of the b-strand elements in the b-solenoid
structure using a proline mutant approach [27]. Here, we relied on
the more subtle alanine scanning approach to analyze the
functional and structural role of specific residues and structural
components of the HET-s PFD fold.
Results
Evolutionary conservation of the PFD region in various
fungal species
Previous studies have analyzed the evolutionary conservation of
the b-solenoid fold [21,35,36,37,38]. Due to the rapid increase in
the number of fully sequenced fungal genomes, many additional
HET-S homologs sequences have become recently available, we
have thus conducted a database search for HET-s/HET-S
homologs in current fungal genome sequences. We could identify
a total of 51 het-s/het-S homologs (file S1). Based on residues found
at 33 of the Helo domain which is known to define HET-s and
HET-S allele specificities [51,52], the homologs found in the other
species are of the HET-S, rather than HET-s-type (Figure S1), as
suggested previously [18,21,30,37]. Some species like Nectria
haematococca and some strains of the Fusarium oxysporum species
complex contained up to 4 het-S paralogs. The majority of the
sequences showed conservation of the 21 amino acid repeat
regions (R1 and R2) but in a fraction of the sequences there was a
two amino acid deletion in the first repeated motif (R1). Figure 1B
shows an alignment of the 22 non redundant sequences for which
both 21-amino acid repeats are conserved. The level of identity
between the sequences is in the range of 30% which is about the
level of identity between the P. anserina HET-s(218–289) and F.
graminearum FgHET-s(218–289) sequences that were previously
found to display closely related structures [38]. It can thus be
reasonably inferred that the sequences presented in the alignment
share similar folds, as previously suggested by homology modeling
Author Summary
Prions are infectious protein particles causing fatal diseases
in mammals. Prions correspond to self-perpetuating
amyloid protein polymers. Prions also exist in fungi where
they behave as cytoplasmic infectious elements. The [Het-
s] prion of the fungus Podospora anserina constitutes a
favorable model for the analysis of the structural basis of
prion propagation because a high resolution structure of
the prion form of [Het-s] is available, a situation so far
unique to this prion model. We have analyzed the relation
between [Het-s] structure and function using alanine
scanning mutagenesis. We have generated 32 single
amino acid variants of the prion forming domain and
analyzed their prion function in vivo and structure by solid-
state NMR. We find that the PFD structure is very robust
and that only a few key mutations affect prion structure
and function. In addition, we find that a C-terminal semi-
flexible loop plays a critical role in prion propagation
although it is not part of rigid amyloid core. This study
offers insights on the structural basis of prion propagation
and illustrates that accessory regions outside of the
amyloid core can critically participate in prion function,
an observation that could be relevant to other amyloid
models.

approaches [35,36]. The positions showing strict conservation are
two of glycines (G242/G278, position 17 of the 21 aa repeat)
located in the arc between the third and fourth b-strand of each
rung, (Figure 1A and B). The N226/N262 asparagine pair
(forming the asparagine ladder at the start of the first b-strand,
position 1) was also conserved although some exceptions occurred.
The second asparagine ladder (N243/N279, position 18) is not as
strongly conserved as the first ladder. There is also a strong
conservation of the hydrophobic residues in the core, large
hydrophobic residues are found at core positions 231/267
(position 6), 239/275 (position 14) and 241/277 (position 16).
There is an interesting trend of mutual exclusion of large
hydrophobic side chains at position 228 and 264 (position 3),
suggesting that the presence of large residues at both positions
might lead to sterical hindrance. Interestingly, two sequences
(Fo_4287-2 and Cg_HET-S) constitute exceptions in that regard
with an isoleucine found both at 228 and 264. But in these
sequences, an Ala residue is found in 231 which might allow for
accommodation of the larger residues in position 3 (i.e. residue 231
in Figure 1A). Although the residues forming the three salt bridges
identified in HET-s (in positions 4, 9 and 11) are not strictly
conserved, there is an overall preference for favorable charge
interactions at these positions. In the 22 listed sequences, favorable
charge combination occurs in 13 and 15 sequences at position 4
and 9 respectively while repulsive interactions are never found. At
position 11, favorable charge interactions are less conserved and
occur in five sequences. Also of note, is the conservation of the
glycine-rich C-terminal loop region encompassing the W287 and
F286 aromatic residues. Conservation occurs not only on the
aromatic positions but also the glycines and the charged residues
(K284 and D288) are strongly conserved. This region is however
entirely missing in a fraction of the sequences. Of note is the fact
that the sequences missing this region are found in species that
contain other HET-S paralogs that do display the loop region.
The conservation is poor in the central loop region between R1
and R2. This region generally contains glycine residues and the
length of the loop region varies from 12 to 18 residues. It was
shown experimentally that three to five amino acid deletions in the

loop region could be tolerated without affecting [Het-s] and HET-
S function [26,27].
In order to achieve an overall comparison of the two repeats, we
devised a separate consensus sequence for repeats R1 and R2
using MEME [53] (Figure 1C). The consensus sequence reveals
some marked differences. In the turn at position 10, there is a
preference for a Glu in R1 and a Gly residue in R2. In position 12,
there is a preference for an Ala and Ser in R1 and R2 respectively,
which is reflected by the reciprocal distribution in position 8. Also,
there is a strong conservation of the Gly at the end of R2 in the
region leading into the C-terminal semi-hydrophobic pocket. The
charge complementary mentioned above is also apparent in these
consensus sequences; with a preference in R1 for positive charges
in position 4 and negative charges in 9 and the opposite preference
in R2. This differential conservation of specific residues in the first
and the second repeat suggest that both repeats are not strictly
functionally equivalent.
Globally, many aspects of the sequence conservation and
variation in HET-s homologs are well explained by the structural
information available. Yet, the role of certain features such as for
instance the conservation of the Arg residue at position 13 is not
directly apparent.
Effect of alanine scanning mutagenesis on [Het-s] activity
in vivo
We set out to analyze the structure-function relation in the
HET-s PFD by generating a series of 32 alanine mutants along the
HET-s PFD and by testing their prion activity in vivo in Podospora
anserina. Based on the sequence conservation described above the
b-strand region and the C-terminal pocket were specifically
targeted (Figure 1A). The mutation coverage amounts to one
mutation every 1.8 residue in these regions. Mutations were
introduced in a plasmid expressing full length HET-s and the
corresponding plasmid was introduced into a Dhet-s strain as
previously reported for proline and deletion mutants of the PFD
[27]. For each mutation, at least 24 individual transformants were
assayed for [Het-s] incompatibility function and for their ability to
infect a [Het-s*] strain. In this experimental setting, transformants
express the transgene from ectopic integration sites and in multiple
copies. This approach allows a rough categorization of the
mutants. Results are presented in Figure 2. In most cases and as
previously observed, the number of transformants able to infect a
[Het-s*] strain is equivalent or higher than those producing a
barrage reaction to [Het-S] [27]. This is likely due to the fact, that
higher prion titers are required to produce an incompatibility
reaction than to infect a [Het-s*] strain.
We have categorized the mutants into three functional classes:
mutations that lead to percentages of active transformants in the
range of wild-type (.60% of active transformants), those
significantly reducing the number of transformants with [Het-s]
activity (.30%and ,60%) and those strongly affecting the
number of active transformants (,30%). The majority of the
mutations (18/32) did not significantly affect [Het-s] activity in this
assay. Nine mutants were slightly affected and five were strongly
affected. The latter corresponded to two group of mutants, the
mutants of the glycine residue at the sharp turn in position 17
(G242A/G278A) and the aromatic F286 and W287 residues in the
C-terminal loop. The Ala replacement of the strongly conserved
Tyr residue ending the second rung (Y281) led also to a marked
decrease in the number of active transformants. The other
mutations having a lesser effect on activity were the mutation of
the Asn pair forming the first asparagines ladder (N226/N262,
position 1). Mutation of the second Asn pair (N243/N279, position
18) had no effect in agreement with the lower conservation of this
second N-pair. In general, mutation of the core hydrophobic
residues did not reduce activity significantly with the exceptions of
I231A and I277A. Also the Ala replacement at positions E234,
K270 and R236 affected the prion function. These residues are
involved in the second and third salt bridges in the HET-s fold.
Mutations in the residues forming the first salt bridge (K229A/
E265A, position 4) had no detectable effect on function in this
assay. The variant Q240A showed a reduced activity. Q240 is
located close to W287 in the structure [28] and it might be that
Q240A also affects this pocket region. Indeed, solid state NMR
studies of the variants at the C-terminus results in chemical shift
changes of Q240 (as discussed below and Figure S3 and S4). The
D288 residue is also located in that spatial neighborhood. The
mutational approach points to an instrumental role of this region
in prion propagation although this region is not part of the
b-solenoid core.
Based on this first series of mutants, we generated a second set of
mutants to specifically test several hypotheses. First, because our
results suggest that the salt bridges are not essential for activity, we
generated a triple mutant that leads to inactivation of all three salt
bridges (E234A, E236A, E265A) and found it to be active
(Figure 2). In respect to this observation it is noteworthy that, there
appears to be an overall conservation of the salt-bridges at position
4 and 9 of the repeat motif, but some HET-S orthologs such as
Cg_HET-S lack these salt bridges completely (Figure 1B). Next, we
have generated a double mutant with both N ladders replaced
(N226A and N243A). This mutant lacked activity suggesting that
at least one N-ladder is required for function and thus providing
evidence for a functional role also for the second N-ladder. In both
rungs there is a conservation of an Arg residue (R238/R274,
position 13). Yet, single Ala replacements at these positions showed
normal function. In a R238A/R274A double variant however the
prion function is affected. This result could explain conservation at
that position. Finally, we reasoned that if a reduced activity of
I231A is caused by a reduction of the hydrophobicity of the core,
one might be able to introduce a compensatory mutation
increasing hydrophobicity elsewhere in the core. We thus changed
the A228 residue of the core by a larger residue. We generated a
I231A/A228V double variant and found that this double mutant
recovered wild-type like activity.
We concluded that in this multicopy assay, the function of
HET-s appears to be very robust with very few mutations having a
very strong effect on prion activity, namely G242A and G278A in
the turns after the triangular core and F286A and W287A in the
C-terminal pocket. Double mutants could also demonstrate the
functional importance of other elements such as the N-ladders, the
hydrophobic core (i.e. I231), and the Arg row at position 238/274.
Detailed analysis of selected mutants assayed as single
copy integrants
The multicopy assay allows an initial functional characterization
of the mutants but does not allow for a detailed and sensitive
analysis of phenotypic differences. We have thus selected a
number of mutants for a more detailed functional characterization
as single copy integrants. In order to have more subtle and
sensitive assays for prion function, we have re-introduced the
mutant allele at the resident het-s locus. We chose to further
analyze a subset of seven single mutants N226A, Q240A, E272A,
K284A, F286, W287, D288A and the R238A/R274A and
T233A/S273A double mutants and the E234A/R236A/E265A
triple mutant. Q240A, K284A, F286A, W287A and D288A were
chosen to investigate the role of the C-terminal loop region. The
triple E234A/R236A/E265A mutant was chosen to analyze in
more detail the effect of the elimination of all three salt-brigdes.

R238A/R274A and T233A/S273A double mutants were includ-
ed to analyze respectively the role of the conserved Arg residues
close to the loop and the role of the partner hydroxyl residues in
the core.
Strains with the corresponding gene replacements were
generated and tested for [Het-s] function. The three mutants
F286A, W287A and R238A/R274A led to a null phenotype as
single copy integrants. This result confirms the functional
importance of the aromatic residues of the C-terminal pocket
and also stresses the functional importance of the conserved Arg
residues at position 13 of each repeat. The remaining mutants
were able to express the [Het-s] phenotype (ie. infect a [Het-s*]
strain and produce a barrage reaction to het-S) and were tested for
three other criteria of prion formation and propagation efficacy.
First, we determined the spontaneous prion formation rate
(Table 1). Secondly, we measured the rate of spreading of the
prion infection in the mycelium, reflecting prion propagation
efficiency (Figure 3). This propagation rate is measured in an
experimental setting where the length of the barrage line
corresponds to the distance of prion spreading in a given period
of time [54] (Figure S2). Third, the rate of spore-killing in the
sexual cycle (a measure of prion maintenance during the sexual
cycle) was determined [24], (Table 2). These three criteria have
been compared previously between wt and a DPaHsp104 mutant.
All three were found to be diminished in this mutant background
[55].
In these assays, all mutants were affected for at least one of the
measured criteria. There was in general a good correlation
between the effect of the mutations on propagation rate and spore
killing activity (Figure 3 and Table 2). Quantitatively the effects of
the mutations were however stronger on spore-killing rates than on
propagation rates. For instance N226A and Q240A were affected
both in propagation rate and spore-killing activity. While E272A,
D288A and T233A/S273A showed close to wt propagation and
killing rates. K284A was an exception as this mutation affected
spore-killing rates although the propagation rate was close to wt.
The E234A/R236A/E265A triple mutant lacking all three salt
bridges was significantly affected in both assays, suggesting that the
salt bridges participate in [Het-s] function although the effect of
the mutation went unnoticed in the more basic multicopy assay
(Figure 2). When spontaneous prion formation rates were
measured, it appeared that N226A and K284A had significantly
reduced spontaneous prion formation rate (Table 1). For K284A,
700 strains were tested but none had spontaneously acquired [Het-
s]. Interestingly, we measured an increase in spontaneous prion
formation rate in D288A and the T233A S273A double mutant.
These mutants represent to our knowledge the first HET-s
mutants with enhanced prion behavior (Table 1).
Solid-state NMR of amyloid fibrils of HET-s(218-289)
variants
In order to get insights into the structural consequences of the
Ala replacements, 2D 13C-13C dipolar assisted rotational reso-
nance (DARR) solid state NMR spectra of amyloid fibrils of the
15N,13C-labeled HET-s(218-289) variants K229A, I231A, V239A,
Q240A, L241A, N262A, V264A, V267A, E272A, S273A, R274A,
I277A, G278A, N279A, F286A, D288A and the double variant
F286A/W287A were recorded and compared with the corre-
sponding spectrum of 15N,13C-labeled wild-type HET-s(218-289)
amyloid fibrils [27,56]. Since the chemical shift is a highly sensitive
probe of the electronic surrounding structure, the measurement of
the 2D 13C-13C DARR spectrum can be regarded as a fingerprint
of the 3D structure. Thus, a comparison of the DARR spectrum of
wild-type and Ala-variant fibrils enables a straight forward analysis
of the preservation or alteration of the b-solenoid fold (Figure 1A).
This atomic-resolution analysis is of particular importance in the
establishment of a structure-activity relationship of amyloids

because many amyloidogenic systems are prone to polymorphism
and thus a secondary structure analyses or structural comparisons
conducted at the mesoscopic level may not be not sufficient to
reveal structural preservation or alterations.
As shown in Figure 4, the 2D DARR spectra of K229A, I231A,
V239, Q240A, L241A, N262A, V264A, E265A, V267A, E272A,
S273A, R274A, I277A, E279A, F286A, W288A, and D288A
closely resemble the wild-type spectrum. This indicates that the
overall structure of the listed variants is conserved. A detailed
inspection of the individual spectra shows in general, small
chemical shift differences of residues close in space to the replaced
amino acid side chain (in addition to the lack of the signal of the
replaced side chain), which is attributed to local structural changes.
For example, in the 2D DARR spectrum of the N262A variant,
cross peak changes of the spatially close residues I231, T261, S263,
V264,and I277 are observed (Figure 4, Figure S3, Figure S4,
Figure 1A). In the case of E265A located at the surface, no
significant chemical shift changes are evident (Figure 4, Figure S3,
Figure S4, Figure 1A). Similar findings are observed for all the
other Ala variants (but G278A, and the double variant F286A/
W287A, see below) as discussed in details in the figure caption of
Figure S3. In the case of I231A, a substantial amount of small local
chemical shift perturbations are observed for A228, K229, D230,
T233, V239, L241, T266, V267, V268, V275 and I277 as well as
for the more remote residues E235, V244, A247, A248, K270,
R274, and L276, hinting that I231 is a structurally important
hydrophobic core residue. In addition to these local chemical shift
alterations, (slight) perturbations of chemical shifts of I277 are
found for many Ala variants (i.e. I231A, Q240A, N262A, V264A,
V267A, R274A, F286A, W287A) indicating that I277, which is
the second Ile side chain in the center of the core of the b-solenoid
structure (Figure 1A), responses sensitively to slight structural
alterations.
In striking contrast to all the variants discussed, the 2D DARR
spectrum of the 15N,13C-labeled variant G278A is reproducibly
distinct from the corresponding spectrum of wild-type HET-s(218–
289) amyloids (Figure 4). The spectrum appears to be less well
dispersed and the cross peaks are broad when compared to wild-
type HET-s(218–289) amyloids. The spectrum is actually remi-
niscent to the spectrum of the non-infectious HET-s(218–289)
amyloid grown at pH 3 which was also found to be less dispersed
and to have broad cross peaks [42]. Hence, it is concluded that the
G278A variant does form a distinct amyloid structure, which may
serve as an explanation of the lack of a prion phenotype (Figure 2;
and see below). The nature of the misfolding of the G278A variant
may be that the Gly residue is key for the arc between the two b-
strands b4a and b4b. In addition, the F286A/W287A double
variant shows a 2D DARR NMR spectrum quite different from
the wild-type DARR spectrum (Figure 4). There are major
chemical shift perturbations spread over the b-solenoid structure
(i.e. I231, S273, E235, K229, T233, N262, R238, A247, V264,
V244, I277, and Q240), making it difficult to assess whether the
double variant forms the b-solenoid fold (Figure 4).
In conclusion, the comparative analysis of the solid state NMR
spectra suggests that all the single Ala variants with the exception
of G278A form the HET-s prion b-solenoid fold. With the
exception of G278A, all the single Ala variants can therefore be
used to explore the detailed structure-infectivity relationship of the
HET-s prion.
Stability measurements of amyloid fibrils of HET-s(218–
289) variants
One of the consequences of a side chain replacement with Ala
may be a change in the stability of the protein fold, which may
influence function [57,58,59,60]. Applied to HET-s this would
mean that a change of the stability of the b-solenoid may alter
heterokaryon incompatibility, spontaneous prion formation, prion
propagation and spore killing (Figure 2, Figure 3, Tables 1 and 2).
In order to get insights into the individual contribution of the
amino acid side chains to the stability of the HET-s prion, Ala
variants K229A, I231A, V239A, Q240A, L241A, N262A, V264A,
V267A, E272A, S273A, G278A, F286A, D288A and F286A/
W287A were measured by a fibril denaturation assay using
GuHCl (Figure 5 and Table 3) following the concept by Santoro
and Bolen to study protein folding and unfolding [61]. However,
here we studied only the fibril denaturation process. This was
monitored by measuring the light scattering at 500 nm (OD500)
[62] versus GuHCl concentration (Figure 5) detecting fibril
disassembly. Since the b-solenoid amyloid structure is composed
of many inter-molecular interactions it is assumed that disassembly
and unfolding occur together and that this detection method
measures thus both fibril disassembly and b-solenoid unfolding.

Such a fibril denaturation reaction mechanism can be of complex
nature but here a simplified two-state process was assumed for the
quantitative analysis. HET-s fibril denaturation studies have been
performed previously using Trp fluorescence as probe for fibril
denaturation [41], because the unique Trp residue (W286) is
located in the C-terminal loop rather than in the actual core, we
favored the use of light scattering because it might constitute a
better probe for the overall unfolding of the fibril since Trp
fluorescence might be affected by local unfolding of the loop.
The individual denaturation curves in triplicates show a
sigmoidal behavior (Figure 5). [61]. For most of the variants (i.e.
wild-type, K229A, I231A, V239A, Q240A, L241A, N262A,
V264A, V267A, E272A, S273A, F286A, D288A) the measure-
ments appear to be reproducible. Only for G278A and possibly
the double variant F286A/W287A a lack of reproducibility is
observed (Figure 5). The lack of reproducibility is attributed to the
altered, possibly polymorphic structure as evidenced by the solid
state NMR spectra (Figure 4). A further qualitative inspection of
Figure 5 suggests that the variants K229A, V239A, L241A,
V264A, V267A, E272A, S273A, and D288A (labeled group 1 in
the following) show sigmoidal denaturation curves similar to wild-
type, while the denaturation curves of the variants I231A, Q240A,
N262A, G278A, F286A (group 2), and the double mutant F286A/
W287A have a different form and properties and are sometimes
less reproducible (as just stated) (see also Table 3, fifth column).
The two-state analysis of the denaturation curves yields two
parameters for the unfolding transition: the m-value and the Gibbs
free energy DG. The m-value is the steepness of the transition and
is generally thought of as a measure of the change in solvent
accessible surface area upon unfolding and reflects how cooper-
ative the unfolding transition is [63,64,65]. The change in Gibbs
free energy (DDG) is a measure of the contribution of the amino
acid side chain to the protein unfolding energy (given that the
structures of the folded and unfolded states as well as the unfolding
pathway are otherwise unperturbed). The variants of group 1 can
all be fitted with a two-state model, most of them with an
unchanged m-value (i.e. the m-value of the wildtype HET-s(218–
289) prion). All the group 1 variants had an unaltered DDG value

or were up to 2 kcal/mol more stable (Table 3). The positive DDG
value for K229A of 1.5 kcal/mol indicates that the salt bridge
between K229 and E265 does not play a favorable stability effect
on the b-solenoid structure. Similarly, the replacement E272A
(removing the E272-R236 salt bridge) results in a positive stability
effect of approximately 2 kcal/mol. The amino acid replacements
in the hydrophobic core at position V239, L241, V264 also had a
1 kcal/mol positive effect on stability V267 had no effect. This is
in line with the in vivo data showing that none of these variants
were affected for the prion phenotype (Figure 2). In combination
with the solid state NMR spectra (Figure 4 and see above), these
unfolding measurements indicate that the Ala variants of group 1
are composed of the same b-solenoid 3D structure and the amino
acid side chain replacement had no negative effect on its unfolding
transition.
In contrast, the GuHCl denaturation curves of group 2 variants
(Figure 5) are distinct from wild-type showing a flattened slope
(lower m-value) (i.e. I231A, Q240A, and N262A) indicative of a
decrease in unfolding cooperativity or a change of the surface. The
latter potential explanation finds support in the surface location of
the Q240. Some replacements comprise a complex unfolding
transition exemplified by an immediate loss of light scattering at
low GuHCl concentrations (i.e. I231A, Q240A, N262A, and
F286A) or poor reproducibility (i.e. G278A and F286A/W287A),
thus for these variants a Gibbs free energy calculation has not been
considered (see Table 3). It is worth mentioning, that the less
reproducible nature of the denaturation curves of G278A and
F286A/W87A is reflected in the less well defined solid state NMR
spectra (Figure 4). Together the data strengthen the notion that
these two variants are not able to fold properly into the b-solenoid
structure. The effect on the denaturation curve of N262A is
attributed to the loss of the conserved Asn ladder. The I231A in
the hydrophobic core replacement appears to influence the
stability and unfolding pathway (Table 3). The NMR analyses
also indicated an important structural role of this residue as the
I231A replacement leads to a substantial amount of chemical shift
perturbations in the b-solenoid fold (Figure 4, Figure S3 and S4).
Most interestingly, with the exception of D288A there appears to
be a perfect correlation between the decrease in prion phenotype
formation in vivo determined by the heterokaryon incompatibility
assay (Figure 2) and the change in the denaturation curve profile
(Table 3).
The F286A and W287A variants of C-terminal pocket are
null alleles but the corresponding proteins form
infectious fibrils in vitro
The F286A and W287A mutants affecting the C-terminal semi-
hydrophobic pocket stand out in virtue for their drastic effect on
[Het-s] activity although the corresponding residues reside outside
the rigid b-solenoid core and do not alter the b-solenoid structure
significantly (Figure 4). Only the double variant F286A/W287A
may be unable to form the b-solenoid structure as suggested by the
solid state NMR studies (Figure 4) and the GuHCl denaturation
curves (Table 3, Figure 5). Moreover, two further mutants in the
same region K284A and D288A also modulate prion behavior in a
subtle way as the first mutation decreases prion formation while
the other in fact increases the prion formation rate (Table 2).
However, the D288A variant shows a wild-type-like solid state
NMR spectrum and is ca. 1.2 kcal/mol more stable than wild-
type, having otherwise a wild-type-like GuHCl denaturation curve
(Figure 4 and 5). We chose to further analyze the mutants in that
region for their ability to form aggregates in vivo as GFP fusion
proteins. We found that neither F286A nor W287A led to the
formation of dot-like aggregates in vivo, however when the mutant
allele as GFP fusion proteins were introduced in a strain expressing
wild-type HET-s (Figure 6), the mutant alleles were found to form
dot-like aggregates presumably by being integrated into wild-type
aggregates, a situation already described for the K284P mutant
residing in the same conserved C-terminal loop region [27].
We also tested infectivity of the variants F286A and W287A
fibrils generated in vitro and found them to be infectious (Table 4).
The level of infectivity of the recombinant fibrils was at least as
elevated as for wild-type fibrils. Infectivity could be detected in the
same level of dilutions as for wild-type fibrils. These results indicate
that once the amyloid fold is acquired, these mutants display wild-
type seeding activity in vivo.
Discussion
The [Het-s] prion of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina
represents an example of a functional amyloid. The amyloid fold
serves as an activation trigger for inducing the transformation of
HET-S into a toxin [30]. We have conducted a mutational
analysis of HET-s PFD to assess the role of specific residues on
prion function and propagation, as well as amyloid structure and
stability. It is observed here that only very few Ala point mutations
are able to abolish prion function, alter significantly the b-solenoid
structure and reduce fibril stability. Most mutants retain partial
function indicative of a robust prion. These studies also revealed a
previously unsuspected role for the C-terminal pocket region in
prion function.
Structure-function of the HET-s fold
The determination of the HET-s b-solenoid structure exposed
the existence of a number of structural elements defining this fold,
such as the hydrophobic core, the asparagines ladders, the sharp
turns connecting the b-strands termed arches [66], the salt bridges,
the internal hydrogen bond between the Thr and Ser residing in
different b-strand layers and the C-terminal loop folding back onto
the core [28,29]. The functional importance of the individual b-
strands was documented before in a mutational approach
involving proline substitutions [27]. Here, it is shown that to
various degrees, the other described structural determinants also
participate in prion function.
Ala replacement of the strictly conserved G278, leads to a null
prion phenotype and this variant is unable to form the b-solenoid
structure as evidenced by the solid state NMR studies. This effect
is very likely due to the importance of the glycine residue in the arc
between b-strands b4a and b4b for the b-solenoid fold (Figure 1).
Ala replacements in the asparagine ladder affected function in vivo
and the N262A variant shows an altered denaturation curve. The
hydrophobic core residues I231 and I277 appear to be important
for prion infectivity (Figure 2) and in the case of I231A also for b-
solenoid unfolding and structure (Table 3, Figure 4). Also, the
Figure 4. 2D Solid state NMR spectra of Ala variants of HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils. The 2D DARR solid state NMR spectra of 15N,13C-
labeled Ala variants of HET-S(218–289) amyloid fibrils are shown on top of the corresponding spectrum of wild-type HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils,
the latter which contour lines are color-coded black. The spectra are labelled according to the amino acid replacement. The close resemblance
between the variant and the wild-type spectra indicates the conservation of the b-solenoid fold in the variants with the exception for G278A and the
double variant F286A/W287A. In Figure S3 the same spectra are shown including the assignment of wild-type HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils [29].

substitution of the highly conserved Thr/Ser pair leads to a
detectable alteration of prion function but only in the spore-killing
assay, while the S273A variant is 1.4 kcal/mol more stable. For
the prion function in vivo, the solvent exposed salt bridges are
important determinants, but their contribution to the b-solenoid
stability is negative (i.e. E272A is 1.9 kcal/mol more stable than
wild-type). Sequence comparisons shows a preference for a
positively charged residue in position 13 of each repeat (R238
and R274 in HET-s) (Figure 1). The functional significance of
these conserved Arg residues is not directly evident. While the
single Ala replacement did not change the prion activity, the
R238A/R274A double mutant leads to a null phenotype thus
providing a functional justification for the sequence conservation.
A possible explanation of the role of these positively charged
residues could be an interaction with the C-terminal loop and in
particular the penultimate conserved Asp residue. In support of
this hypothesis, is the fact that the two sequences that are
exceptions to the conservation of positively charged residues at
these positions also lack the C-terminal glycine-rich loop like
Fo_CL52-2 and Nh_mpVI-1, (Figure 1B).
In the presented Ala mutagenesis scan, two mutants were found
for which spontaneous prion formation rate was increased rather
than decreased, the D288A mutant and the T233A/S273A double
mutant. This would indicate that the HET-s PFD does not have an
optimal behavior in terms of prion formation rates. It might be
that the increased prion formation rate of D288A is due to the
higher stability of the variant (i.e. DDG = +1.2 kcal/mol, Table 3)
or/and a modification of the properties of the C-terminal loop
which is functionally important for a prion phenotype (see below).
The T233A/S273A double mutation increases the overall
hydrophobicity of the core. Possibly, this increase in hydropho-
bicity favors a hydrophobic collapse and subsequent prion
nucleation and/or stabilizes the b-solenoid fold since already the
amyloid of S273A alone is 1.4 kcal/mol more stable (Table 3).
Interestingly, the D288 and the S273 residues (and to a lesser
extend T233) are conserved positions (Figure 1B). Thus, one may
hypothesize that conservation at these positions reflects the need to
reduce spontaneous b-solenoid folding because a too strong
propensity for spontaneous folding might lead to uncontrolled
activation of the HET-S pore-forming toxin. Similarly, the fact
that several replacements increase rather than decrease stability
also suggests that the HET-s PFD sequence is not optimized for
highest possible stability. The theoretical model of prion propa-
gation by the Weissman group [67] and others [68,69] highlights
that for the prion propagation, amyloid fibril fragmentation is
necessary. Thus, highest possible amyloid stability may not be
compatible with the function of the HET-s fold.
Modulating prion formation by a short sequence stretch
located outside of the cross-b core
One finding of this study is the detection of the functional
importance of a 7 amino acid residues C-terminal loop starting at
Figure 5. GuHCl unfolding measurements of HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils and Ala variants thereof. The GuHCl denaturation curve of
amyloid fibrils of HET-s(218–289) and Ala variants (as indicated) were measured by the OD500 (y-axis) at various GuHCl concentration (x-axis) after
incubation in the corresponding GuHCl buffers for one day. The change of the OD500 value is indicative of the loss of large aggregated protein
species. Three samples each were incubated and the individual measurements are highlighted by asterisks, by small dots, or by open circles,
respectively. Individual successful fits following the concept by Santoro and Bolen to study protein folding and unfolding [61] are shown by black
lines and the calculated change in Gibbs energy (DG) with its standard deviation from the three measurements are listed in Table 3.

the end of b-strand b4b and ending at the C-terminus of the
protein (GKGFWDN, residue 283 to 289). The only previous
indication of the functional importance of this region came for the
observation that the K284P mutation affects HET-s aggregate
formation in vivo [27]. Structurally, this region forms a semi-
hydrophobic pocket that folds back onto the space delimited by
the third and fourth strand of each rung [28]. This part of the
structure is less well defined and appears to be more dynamic than
the core region. The individual mutations of the two aromatic
residues F286A and W287A have a very strong effect on activity.
Actually, these two mutations are the most severe ones in our set of
32 mutants together with the mutations of the Gly in the arc
positions (i.e. G242/G278). In addition, the mutations of the
conserved charged residues in that region K284A, D288A (and the
structurally nearby Q240A) also affect function. As noted above,
the D288A mutation produced an unexpected effect on prion
function as this mutation increased spontaneous [Het-s] prion
formation. This is the first mutation found to increase [Het-s]
prion formation. Of note however is that other criteria such as the
spore-killing activity are in fact slightly reduced in that mutant.
A recent molecular dynamics simulation study of the HET-
s(218–289) b-solenoid suggested that the F286A and W287A
mutations reduce flexibility at the fibril ends and that this flexibility
is an important determinant for prion fibril infectivity [70].
However, F286A and W287A are able to form fibrils in vitro that
display the same levels of infectivity as wild-type fibrils suggesting
that mutation of the aromatic residues does not critically affect
templating activity and the 3D structure of the b-solenoid fold.
Alternatively, the hydrophobic nature of F286 and W287 may be
important for an initial non specific hydrophobic interaction of the
incoming molecule with the prion template. This hypothesis is
supported by the solid state NMR spectra of both variants
indicating no significant structural changes of the b-solenoid fold.
Rather it appears that this region might be required for the prion
formation process without actually being part of the cross-b part of
the fold. These interpretation illustrates that amyloid folding can
be dramatically modulated in a functionally relevant way by a
sequence stretch that is not actually part of the cross-b structure per
se. Strikingly, this part of the HET-s PFD sequence turns out to be
the region of the protein with the highest level of sequence
conservation. While, the repeat region can accommodate a
significant level of divergence and still retain the ability to adopt
the b-solenoid fold, the ability for this short C-terminal region to
act possibly as a folding inducer of the repeat region appears
highly constrained at the sequence level. The b-solenoid forming
region of HET-s/HET-S is thus located between the HeLo
domain which can have a prion inhibitory function and the C-
terminal pocket region which acts as a prion promoting region

[26]. These results revealing the existence of a short amyloid
folding modulator stretch that is not directly involved in the
cross-b core could be of general importance in the identifica-
tion of sequence determinants for relevant amyloid formation
and in efforts to control amyloid aggregation in disease related
systems.
Level of complexity of the b-solenoid fold
Since many proteins are able to aggregate into amyloid-like
entities and since the inter-molecular b-sheet formation with its
many hydrogen bonds is an essential determinant of the cross-b-
sheet motif, it has been suggested that the formation of amyloid
fibrils is mainly a generic property of the polypeptide backbone
and that the side chains play a minor role [71]. On the contrary,
amyloid aggregation is highly amino-acid sequence specific as
demonstrated by the intermolecular side chain interactions
observed in the crystal structures [72,73,74] and the essential
involvement of side chain interactions in the aggregation process
as evidenced for example by the experimentally-derived scale of
amino-acid aggregation-propensities (ranging from the aggrega-
tion-prone hydrophobic residues to the aggregation-interfering
charged side chain [75,76,77]). These observations accompanied
with the predictive power of several algorithms for the cross-b
aggregation propensity of polypeptide sequences [78,79,80]
suggests that the cross-b state is less complex than most structures
of soluble proteins, indicating that the complexity of the cross-b
fold may fall somewhere between a secondary and a tertiary
structure [2].
This notion of intermediate folding complexity of amyloids is
now supported by the stability measurements of the HET-s Ala
variants. Indeed, our study reveals both the absence of destabi-
lizing effect for many replacements but also the critical importance
of certain key residues. While the loss of side chain hydrogen
bonds, salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions in soluble
proteins yields in general a DDG loss of ,22 kcal/mol
[58,59,60], in the case of the HET-s prion, the DDG for the
group 1 variants with K229A and E272A deleting a salt bridge,
S273A getting rid of a side chain hydrogen bond, and V239A,
L241A, V264A, and V267A reducing the hydrophobicity of the
core, is either insignificant or with a positive value of up to +
2 kcal/mol (Table 3). In particular, hydrophobic core residue
replacements have little effect (+0.6 kcal/mol in average; Table 3)
compared to the average DDG of ,22 kcal/mol predicted from
data of soluble proteins. Only a few side chains appear to be
crucial for the formation of the b-solenoid structure (such as for
instance I231 and N262). Side chain replacements of such residues
lead to in vivo effects but also to noticeable changes of the GuHCl
denaturation curve. Thus, it appears that alteration of the b-
solenoid structure can be achieved either by Pro insertions [27]
having a drastic consequences on the backbone structure or by
replacing side chains of a limited number of key residues that
appear critical for directing the peptide backbone into the b-
solenoid fold.
Materials and Methods
Strains, plasmids and media
P. anserina strains used in this study were wild-type het-s, het-S,
Dhet-s strains and the DPaHsp104 strain [55]. Growth medium for
barrage assays and prion transmission assays was standard corn
meal agar DO medium. The Dhet-s strain was constructed by
inserting the nat1 cassette from the pAPI508 plasmid [81] in place
of the het-s ORF. The nat1 cassette was amplified with
oligonucleotides 59 CTTCCCTTCCACTTCTTCACAC 39 and
59 ATCCTAGATGACTTAAGACGACAGG 39. The sequences
upstram and downstream of the het-s ORF were amplified
respectiviely with oligonucleotide pairs 59 AAGCTTTTC-
GAATTGGTCTCTCAG 39 and 59GGGCAGTTTGAGGG-
GAAAGCGAAG 39 and 59 GGGACTAGTACCCTCCAG-
CAAGGATAGC 39 and 59 GCGGCCGCCATGGGCACT-
GCATCTGGG 39. The fragments were ligated to create the
het-s::nat-1 cassette cloned as a HindIII-NcoI fragment in a pSK
plasmid. This cassette was used to transform a het-s DPaKu70 strain
[81]. Nourseothricine resistant transformants compatible with a
het-S tester were selected. Inactivation of het-s was verified by PCR
using oligonucleotides 59 CGACGATCACAGCTATAGCGT-
GGTG 39 and 59 ATCCGGCTTCCCTGGACCTGCTTC 39.
The strain was then backcrossed once to a het-s wild-type strains
and Dhet-s (NourR and het-S compatible) Dhet-s DKu70 strains
(NourR, PhleoR and het-S compatible) were selected in the progeny.
Prion propagation, prion formation and incompatibility
assays
Methods for determination of incompatibility phenotypes, prion
formation and prion propagation were as previously described
[54]. In brief, incompatibility phenotypes were determined by
confronting strains of solid corn meal agar medium to [Het-s] and
[Het-S] tester strains and visualizing the formation of barrages
(abnormal contact lines forming upon confrontation of incompat-
ible strains). [Het-s] prion propagation was assayed as the ability to
transmit the [Het-s] prion from a [Het-s]-donor strain to a [Het-
s*] prion-free tester strain after confrontation on solid medium.
Prion formation rates of [Het-s] were determined by measuring
the fraction of [Het-s*] or subcultures that spontaneously acquired
the prion phenotype after 5 days of growth at 26uC.
Microscopy
For fluorescence microscopy, synthetic medium containing 2%
(wt/vol) agarose was poured as two 10 ml layers of medium. P.
anserina hyphae were inoculated on this medium and cultivated for
16 to 24 h at 26uC. The top layer of the medium was then cut out
and the mycelium was examined with a Leica DMRXA
microscope equipped with a Micromax CCD (Princeton Instru-
ments) controlled by the Metamorph 5.06 software (Roper
Scientific). The microscope was fitted with a Leica PL APO
100X immersion lens.
Protein preparation and fibril formation
HET-s(218–289), HET-s(218–289) Ala variants proteins were
expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described [27]. Both
proteins had a C-terminal 6 histidine tag and expressed as
insoluble proteins and purified under denaturing conditions using
Qiagen columns. Yields were in the range of 10 mg/L of culture.
Proteins were eluted in 6 M GuHCl 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8,
150 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole. Elution buffer was replaced
by 175 mM acetic acid by passage on a 5 ml Hitrap column
(Amersham). After lyophilisation the samples were stored at 2
20uC.
The protein variants were dissolved in diluted HCl (45 mM)
and the concentration adjusted to 90 mM which was affirmed by
UV absorption at 280 nm. The solution was filtered through a
0.2 mM filter and Buffer E (Tris [3 M]; NaCl [1 M] HCl
[45 mM] 1/19 V) was added such that the end concentration of
NaCl and Tris were 150 and 50 mM respectively. If necessary
pH was adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH (4 M). Samples were
rotated at 37uC on a rotator at constant speed for at least one
week.

Protein transfection assays
Protein transfection experiments with amyloid fibrils of recom-
binant HET-s(218–289) variants were performed using a cell
disruptor (Fast-prep FP120, Bio101, Qbiogen Inc.). For each test,
,0.5 cm3 of [Het-s*] mycelium grown on solid medium is sheared
(run time 30 s, speed 6) in 500 ml of STC50 buffer (0.8 M sorbitol,
50 mM CaCl2, 100 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5) and the sonicated
HET-s(218–289) amyloids assembled at pH 7 (20 ml at 1 mM) in a
2 ml screw cap tube. The sheared mycelium is then diluted with
600 ml of STC50 buffer and then plated onto DO20.8 M sorbitol
medium and incubated at 26uC until being confluent (7–8 days).
Several implants (at least two per mycelium) are checked for the
[Het-s] phenotype in barrage tests.
Denaturation measurements of amyloid fibrils of HET-
s(218–289) variants
The fibril containing samples of the various HET-s(218–289)
variants were concentrated after centrifugation (20000 g; 10 min)
to 500 mM. The fibrils were then diluted in the different GuHCl
stock solutions (between 0–8 M in 0.5 M steps) to an end
concentration of 20 mM. It is important to note that the fibril
samples were added to the GuHCl solution by an Eppendorf
pipette with a single extrusion. The samples were incubated at
room temperature without shaking for one day or if stated for one
week, respectively. The extent of amyloid disassembly was
monitored by the measurement of the optical density at 500 nm
(OD500) on a JASCO V-650 spectrophotometer with quartz
cuvettes and an adaptor from Eppendorf. The OD500 is believed
to be an indirect measure of the amount of protein aggregation.
Each experiment has been measured three times starting in part
from different sample preparations. The analysis and extraction of
the DG and m-value was done by the software package MATLAB
following the mathematical formula and procedures of Santoro
and Bolen [61].
As stated above the samples were incubated before the OD500
measurement at the various concentrations of GuHCl for one day
in order to reach equilibrium conditions. Longer incubation
periods such as one week did either not alter the measurements as
demonstrated for the V267A variant in Figure S5, or a flattening
of the denaturation curve was observed as shown for the V264A
variant (Figure S5). The flattening of the curve is interpreted as a
restructuring of the amyloid aggregate during the long incubation
time of one week, which let us concentrate on the use of the
denaturation measurements with one day incubation for the
quantitative analysis. Although in the case of V264A the extracted
DG value did not alter between the two type of measurements
(Figure S5), the change of the denaturation curve indicates that in
GuHCl only a pseudo-equilibrium is obtained. Another point
worth mentioning is that highly reproducible denaturation curves
were obtained by incubating the protein in GuHCl solution
without shaking, while in presence of shaking the reproducibility
was only moderate (data not shown).
Solid state NMR of amyloid fibrils of 15N,13C-labeled HET-
s(218–289) variants
All the solid-state NMR experiments were conducted on a
AVANCE II Bruker 600 MHz (14. 1 T) spectrometer using a
Bruker 3.2 mm probe. DARR spectra with 20 ms mixing time
were obtained from 15N,13C-labeled HET-s(218–289) variants
[82]. All the spectra were processed using Topspin 2.0 (Bruker
Biospin), using a shifted cosine squared window function as
indicated in the Figure captions and so called zero-filling was done
to the next power of two in both dimensions. Automated baseline
correction was applied in the direct dimension. For spectral
analysis the software package CcpNMR Analysis [83] was used
and the chemical shift list was taken from [56].
Sequence analysis
HET-S homologs were recovered from available genome
databases at ncbi (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and jgi
(http://genome.jgi-psf.org/) using BLAST searches. Multiple
alignments were performed with CLUSTALW2 at http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/. The consensus sequence of the
R1 and R2 repeats were generated using MEME at meme.nbcr.-
net/, [53]. The MEME output gives a graphical representation of
the consensus sequence as a weighted consensus in which the size
of the letter designating a given amino acid is proportional to the
conservation of the residue in the different sequences used to
generate the motif. The size of the character reflects the
information content measured in bits.

Figure S1 Alignment of N-terminal region of HET-s/
HET-S homologs. The N-terminal regions (1–34/35) of the
sequences listed in File S1 have been aligned with ClustalW2. The
HET-s and HET-S sequences are boxed in red. At position 33
(H33 in HET-S and P33 in HET-s), no sequence is of the HET-s
type and most sequences are of the HET-S type. In addition to H,
amino acids found at that position are R, Q and N. It was shown
that H33R, H33Q and H33N HET-S variants retain het-S
specificity [51;52]. The sole exception is the Nh-mpIV-4 sequence
from Nectria haematococca showing a L at that position. The H33L
mutation in HET-S leads to the het-s specificity [51,52]. In
addition this sequence contains a deletion in the N-terminal
region, making it possible that this sequence corresponds to a
HET-s homolog.

s]-propagation rate. A row of 6 wild-type and mutant [Het-s*]
subcultures are inoculated on solid medium and the first strains of
the row is infected with wild-type [Het-s] (grey arrow) and
confronted to HET-S tester strains, the prion propagates from one
subculture to another. The barrage line in the confrontation zone
with the HET-S tester shows the progression of the prion infection
at the time of contact with the HET-S tester, that is about
10 hours after infection of the first strain in the row. The distance
measured between the two white diamonds is the distance
reported in Figure 3.

Figure S3 2D Solid state NMR spectra of Ala variants of
HET-s(218–289) amyloid fibrils for variants K229A to
V267A. The 2D DARR solid state NMR spectra of 15N,13C-
labeled Ala variants of HET-S(218–289) amyloid fibrils are shown
on top of the corresponding spectrum of wild-type HET-s(218–

black. These are the same spectra as in Figure 4 with some cross
peak assignment. The comparison between the 2D DARR of the
Ala variant amyloid fibrils and the wild-type HET-s(218–289)
amyloid fibrils indicates the preservation of the b-solenoid fold of
all the Ala variants with small structural changes close to the
replaced amino acid side chains as evidenced by small chemical
shift perturbations upon Ala replacement. A significant chemical
shift change is documented if the cross peak did shift approxi-
mately half a line width or more. In the following for each Ala
variant these chemical shift perturbations are described: for

K229A there is only a slight chemical shift change observed for
resonances of V264. For I231A a substantial amount of spatial
local chemical shift perturbations are observed including A228,
K229, D230, T233, V239, L241, T266, V267, V268, V275, and
I277 as well as the spatial not close residues E235, V244, A247,
A248, K270, R274, and L276 did show also small chemical shift
perturbations. For V239A only the spatially close residues I231,
T233, R274, and I271 show chemical shift perturbations. For
Q240A only R274, V239, V244, and I277 show slight chemical
shift changes; for L241A: A228, K229, I231, E235, Q240, and
I277, as well as the structurally further away positioned S273 and
V264; for N262A: V264, I231, T261, S263, and I277, as well as
the structurally further away positioned T266, and K270; for
V264A: only A228 and I277; and for E265A nothing significantly.
For the hydrophobic core residue V267A perturbed chemical
shifts are of the core residues K229, I231, I277, V268, T233, and
T266 and the spatially not close residue V244; For E272A no
significant shifts are observed, for the Thr/Ser ladder residue
S273A, chemical shift perturbations are observed for its partner
T233, for R236, R274, and I277, respectively. For R274A as well
as for N279A, no significant chemical shifts are observed. For the
Ala replacement of the hydrophobic core residue I277 perturbed
chemical shifts are of residues V264 and R274. For the single
variants F286A, W287A, as well as D288A the shifts of the close in
space residues V239 (only for F286A and W287A), Q240, V244,
and R274 (and I277 for F286A) are altered.

denaturation curves after 1 day and 1 week of incubation
in GuHCl. The GuHCl denaturation curve of amyloid fibrils of
HET-s(218–289) V264A and V267A (as indicated) were measured
by the OD500 (y-axis) at various GuHCl concentration (x-axis)
after incubation in the corresponding GuHCl buffers for one day
(black data, 1 d) or one week (green data, 1 w), respectively. While
the extracted DG values are very similar for both types of
measurement, in the case of V264A a flattening of the
denaturation curve upon incubation in GuHCl for one week is
evident indicating that during the long incubation restructuring of
the amyloid may start to happen.
