The most prevalent diseases manifested by Escherichia coli are acute and
recurrent bladder infections and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases such as
Crohn’s disease. E. coli clinical isolates express the FimH adhesin, which consists
of a mannose-specific lectin domain connected via a pilin domain to the tip
of type 1 pili. Although the isolated FimH lectin domain has affinities in the
nanomolar range for all high-mannosidic glycans, differentiation between these
glycans is based on their capacity to form predominantly hydrophobic
interactions within the tyrosine gate at the entrance to the binding pocket. In
this study, novel crystal structures of tyrosine-gate mutants of FimH, ligand-free
or in complex with heptyl -d-O-mannopyranoside or 4-biphenyl -d-O-
mannopyranoside, are combined with quantum-mechanical calculations and
molecular-dynamics simulations. In the Y48A FimH crystal structure, a large
increase in the dynamics of the alkyl chain of heptyl -d-O-mannopyranoside
attempts to compensate for the absence of the aromatic ring; however, the
highly energetic and stringent mannose-binding pocket of wild-type FimH is
largely maintained. The Y137A mutation, on the other hand, is the most
detrimental to FimH affinity and specificity: (i) in the absence of ligand the
FimH C-terminal residue Thr158 intrudes into the mannose-binding pocket and
(ii) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid interacts strongly with Glu50, Thr53 and
Asn136, in spite of multiple dialysis and purification steps. Upon mutation, pre-
ligand-binding relaxation of the backbone dihedral angles at position 137 in the
tyrosine gate and their coupling to Tyr48 via the interiorly located Ile52 form the
basis of the loss of affinity of the FimH adhesin in the Y137A mutant.
1. Introduction
Escherichia coli infections are the most common infections
in the human urinary tract (Goneau et al., 2015; Hooton &
Stamm, 1997), but E. coli is also involved in many other
infections, for example Crohn’s disease-associated microbial
dysbiosis (Darfeuille-Michaud et al., 2004). These Gram-
negative bacteria express type 1 fimbriae on their surface:
long, hair-like proteinaceous organelles assembled at the outer
membrane usher with the assistance of the periplasmic
chaperone FimC (Choudhury et al., 1999). The FimH adhesin
is located at the tip of the fimbriae and consists of an
N-terminal lectin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain that
connects FimH to the rest of the pilus via FimG followed by
FimF (Le Trong, Aprikian, Kidd, Thomas et al., 2010). The
FimH lectin binds specifically to mannose moieties displayed
on glycoproteins at the luminal surface of epithelial cells
(Gouin et al., 2014). Attachment of bacteria to the bladder
epithelium is followed by their internalization and subsequent
biofilm formation inside the urothelial cells (Anderson et al.,
2004), which facilitates their persistence within the urinary
tract. FimH-mediated binding is enhanced under shear force
(Thomas et al., 2002). The origin of this binding enhancement
is the disruption of the quaternary interactions between the
lectin and pilin domains of FimH by shear force, morphing the
lectin into an elongated -sandwich with high affinity (Le
Trong, Aprikian, Kidd, Forero-Shelton et al., 2010). When the
shear force is alleviated, the number of interactions between
the lectin and pilin domains increases again at the expense of
FimH affinity towards the ligand (Aprikian et al., 2007).
Antibiotics are the standard treatment for E. coli infections;
however, their long-term use promotes the development of
microbial resistance, leading to recurrent infections and thus
accounting for significant morbidity (Geerlings et al., 2014).
Anti-adhesive drugs prevent the binding and ensure the
clearance of type 1 piliated E. coli from epithelial linings
(Sivignon et al., 2015). They present a promising alternative
treatment to antibiotics, in particular because anti-adhesives
are unlikely to induce bacterial resistance as they do not
interfere with the bacterial metabolism: their effect is neither
bacteriostatic nor bacteriolytic. The knowledge needed for the
design of FimH antagonists is traditionally based on crystal
structures (Choudhury et al., 1999; Bouckaert et al., 2013;
Brument et al., 2013; Cusumano et al., 2011; Firon et al., 1987;
Hartmann & Lindhorst, 2011; Klein et al., 2010; Han et al.,
2012). The earliest report on potential anti-adhesives
described the FimC chaperone holding the FimH adhesin that
accommodated cyclohexylbutanoyl-N-hydroxyethyl-d-gluc-
amide (C-HEGA) at the tip. The linear glucosamide of
C-HEGA, which was used as an additive in the crystallization
condition, gave the first indications of the position of the
mannose-binding site and its interactions (Choudhury et al.,
1999). By crystallizing the FimH–FimC complex in the
presence of methyl -d-mannopyranoside, the first FimH
structures in complex with its most specific sugar, mannose,
appeared shortly afterwards (Hung et al., 2002). Mannose
binds in a deep and polar pocket at the N-terminal end of
FimH, in which the amino acids Phe1, Asn46, Asp47, Asp54,
Gln133, Asn135, Asp140 and Phe142 create a dense network
of 12 hydrogen bonds with each hydroxyl group of the
pyranose ring except that at the -anomeric position of
mannose. More recent crystal structures of the FimH lectin are
complexed with O-linked (Fiege et al., 2015), N-linked
(Brument et al., 2013; Chalopin et al., 2016) and C-linked (de
Ruyck et al., 2016) mannosides that are less sensible to
glycosidases and better suited for therapeutic use (Mydock-
McGrane et al., 2016).
In the first high-resolution structures of the FimH lectin
domain, n-butyl -d-mannopyranoside was serendipitously
found strongly bound in the mannose-binding site (Bouckaert
et al., 2005). These structures showed that the butyl aglycon
extending from the mannose ring interacts with Ile52, which
bridges residues Tyr48 and Tyr137. These tyrosine residues
form the so-called tyrosine gate. The tyrosine gate has recently
attracted great interest because of its potential to generate
nanomolar affinities for mannosides conjugated to hydro-
phobic aglycons through the formation of favourable van der
Waals and stacking interactions within the gate. Aglycon
substituents either travel through the gate like natural high-
mannose N-linked glycans (Wellens et al., 2008), for example
the biphenyl aglycon moiety of a C-linked mannoside (de
Ruyck et al., 2016), or interact in multiple possible stacking
modes with Tyr48 alone (Han et al., 2010) or with both tyro-
sines of the gate (Wellens et al., 2012; Kleeb et al., 2015).
To establish a detailed interaction profile of the tyrosine-
gate residues and to rationalize the binding affinities of
various FimH antagonists, we generated single-residue FimH
mutants in which one of the two tyrosine-gate residues was
mutated to alanine (Y48A and Y137A). The effect of these
mutations on the binding of three synthetic ligands was tested
by protein crystallography, by measuring affinities and by
molecular-simulation studies. These data highlight the impor-
tance of Tyr137, as its mutation clearly alters the binding
properties of the FimH lectin. The ligand-free state of Y137A
FimH permits the C-terminal carboxylate of a neighbouring
molecule to enter its mannose-binding pocket. This mutant
also binds a buffer molecule in a shallow surface pocket near
Glu50, Thr53 and Asn136. In the ligand-free state of Y137A
FimH, several of the binding-site residues (including Asn136,
Tyr137 and Tyr48) already sample backbone dihedral angles
that are normally only found in wild-type FimH upon binding
of the mannose. Simulations indicate a dynamic coupling of
Tyr137 with Tyr48 via Ile52. Altogether, these data can explain
the significantly lower binding affinity towards the compounds
tested here in the Y137A mutant compared with the wild-type
lectin. The results presented here thus considerably improve
our understanding of FimH–mannoside interaction and guide
a better design strategy for FimH antagonists.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagents
Bacto Yeast Extract, Bacto Agar and Bacto Tryptone were
purchased from Becton Dickinson (Basel, Switzerland) and
used for the preparation of LB (Luria–Bertani) culture
medium. Isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was
obtained from Applichem (Darmstadt, Germany). Polymyxin
B sulfate, HEPES [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-piperazine-1-ethane-
sulfonic acid], oxalic acid, MgCl2, CaCl2, NaH2PO4 and
imidazole were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Ampicillin,
bovine serum albumin (BSA), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), amino acids and BME vitamin mix were
obtained from Sigma. The sugars 1,5-anhydro-d-mannitol
(AM), n-heptyl -d-mannopyranoside (HM) and the
4-biphenyl -d-mannopyranoside (BF) were synthesized as
described previously (Pang et al., 2012).

2.2. Cloning of tyrosine-gate mutants
The FimH lectin-domain construct linked to the thrombin
cleavage site (Th) and a His6 tag (6His) was generated as
described by Rabbani et al. (2010). The Y48A and Y137A
mutants were generated by the overlap extension PCR
method using the plasmid encoding the wild type (WT) as a
template. The inserts were digested with HindIII and XbaI
restriction enzymes, gel-purified and subsequently ligated into
the corresponding cloning site of pDsbA3 expression vector.
The vectors were then transformed into E. coli DH5 chemo-
competent cells (Novagen, Lucerne, Switzerland). After
plasmid isolation and restriction control, the correctness of the
constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Microsynth,
Balgach, Switzerland). Finally, the vectors were transformed
into the protease-deficient E. coli strain HM 125 (Meerman &
Georgiou, 1994) for protein expression.
2.3. Protein expression and purification
Bacterial clones were grown at 30C with vigorous shaking
(300 rev min1) in M9 minimal medium (Sambrook, 1989)
supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 20%
glucose, 10 mM of each amino acid, BME vitamin mix (Sigma,
Buchs, Switzerland) and 100 mg ml1 ampicillin. When an
OD600 of 0.8 was reached, the cells were induced with 1 mM
IPTG and cultivated for a further 16 h at 30C and
300 rev min1. The cells were then cooled on ice for 5 min and
harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rev min1 for 20 min at
4C. The pellet was suspended in a cold solution of 50 mM
Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mg ml1
polymyxin B sulfate (lysis buffer) and stirred for 2 h at 4C.
After centrifugation at 11 000 rev min1 for 20 min at 4C,
the supernatant (periplasmic extract) was dialyzed overnight
against 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole
pH 8 (binding buffer) and applied onto an Ni–NTA column
(Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) attached to a BioLogic fast
protein liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad, Reinach BL,
Switzerland). The column was washed with binding buffer and
was subsequently eluted with 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM
NaCl, 250 mM imidazole pH 8 (elution buffer). The fractions
containing FimH were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM
HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 pH 7.4 (assay buffer).
The purity of the protein was verified by SDS–PAGE analysis
and the amount was determined by HPLC (Bitsch et al., 2003)
using BSA as a standard. Aliquots of the proteins could be
stored for up to three months at 4C. For long-term storage,
the proteins were frozen at 80C without additives. For
protein crystallization purposes, a FimH lectin construct
(amino acids 1–158) without any tag was generated and was
purified by ion-exchange chromatography (Vetsch et al., 2002).
2.4. Circular-dichroism analysis
The far-UV region of a protein circular-dichroism (CD)
spectrum delivers spectral features that are directly relevant to
the secondary structure of the protein. To analyze the effect of
the mutations on the secondary structure of FimH, CD spectra
of the wild type and mutants were recorded. The proteins were
diluted to a concentration of 10 mM in 10 mM sodium phos-
phate buffer pH 7.4 and CD spectra were measured at 25C
using a thermostat-controlled 0.1 cm cell. The spectra were
recorded between 190 and 250 nm with 2 nm bandwidth and
ten scans per sample on a Jasco J-720 spectrophotometer with
a PFD-350S temperature controller connected to the J-700
software program. CD spectra were corrected for background
by subtracting buffer spectra and the CD signal was converted
to residue ellipticity ([]MRW in deg cm
2 dmol1).
2.5. Fluorescence measurements
The conformational stability was verified by monitoring the
guadinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced unfolding profiles of
the wild type and mutants. Prior to spectroscopic measure-
ments, the samples (10 mM) were incubated with GdmCl
concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 M for 24 h at 25C. The
effective GdmCl concentrations were determined from the
refractive indices of the samples (Pace, 1986). Fluorescence
measurements were performed on a Hitachi F4500 fluores-
cence spectrometer at 25C using an excitation slit of 2.5 nm
and an emission slit of 5 nm. All samples were excited at  =
280 nm and the spectra were recorded at a scan speed of
10 nm min1. The fluorescence emission for equilibrium
unfolding experiments was followed at  = 350 nm (trypto-
phan fluorescence). Fluorescence spectra were corrected for
background by subtracting buffer spectra. All transitions were
evaluated according to a two-state model using the linear
extrapolation method and normalized.
2.6. Protein mass-spectrometric analysis
The exact molecular weights of wild-type FimH lectin and
the tyrosine mutants were determined by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry.
2.7. Competitive binding assay
To evaluate the affinity of the mutants, a previously
described competitive binding assay (Rabbani et al., 2010) was
used. Briefly, 100 ml per well of a 10 mg ml1 solution of FimH
in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2 pH 7.4 (assay
buffer) was coated onto a MaxiSorp Nunc (Roskilde,
Denmark) 96-well microtitre plate overnight at 4C. The
coating solution was discarded and the wells were blocked
with 150 ml per well of 3% bovine serum albumin in assay
buffer for 2 h at 4C. After three washing steps with assay
buffer (150 ml per well), a serial dilution of the test compound
(50 ml per well) in assay buffer consisting of 5% dimethyl
sulfoxide and Man1,3(Man1,6)Man1,4GlcNAc1,4GlcNAc-
-PAA-biotin glycopolymer (Lectinity, Moscow, Russia)
saturated with peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (50 ml per well
of a 0.5 mg ml1 solution) was added. The plates were incu-
bated for 3 h at 25C and 350 rev min1 and then carefully
washed four times with 150 ml per well assay buffer. Colour
was developed using 100 ml 2,20-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothia-
zoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the substrate per well. The reaction
was stopped after 4 min by the addition of 2% aqueous oxalic
acid before the optical density was measured at 415 nm on a

microplate reader. The IC50 values of the compounds tested in
duplicate were calculated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, USA). The IC50 defines the molar
concentration of the test compound that reduces the maximal
specific binding of glycopolymer to FimH lectin by 50%. The
relative IC50 (rIC50) is the ratio of the IC50 of the test
compound to the IC50 of n-heptyl -d-mannopyranoside and
was set to 1 for wild-type FimH.
2.8. Isothermal titration calorimetry
A thermodynamic characterization of the interactions
between WT, Y48A and Y137A FimH lectin and mannosides
was obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The
protein was dialyzed overnight at 4C against assay buffer
using Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes with 10 kDa cutoff
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
FimH concentrations of 10–27 mM were used in the
measurement cell. The ligands AM, HM and BF were diluted
to a tenfold to 20-fold molar excess of the protein. The dilution
enthalpy was determined by ligand in assay buffer titration.
All measurements were performed with a MicroCal VP-ITC
instrument (GE Healthcare, Northampton, Massachusetts,
USA; sample-cell volume of 1.4523 ml) at 25C, 307 rev min1
stirring speed and 10 mcal s1 reference power. The ligand was
injected in 4–8 ml steps (38–66 injections in total) with a
spacing of 10 min to ensure non-overlapping peaks. Sigmoidal
binding curves with complete saturation were obtained at the
end of each experiment. Baseline correction and peak inte-
gration were performed using Origin 7 (OriginLab, North-
ampton, Massachusetts, USA). Baseline subtraction and
curve-fitting with the three variables n (molar ratio), Kd
(dissociation constant) and H (change in enthalpy) were
performed using a global analysis with SEDPHAT v.10.40
(National Institutes of Health; Houtman et al., 2007). The
parameters G (change in free energy) and S (change in
entropy) were calculated by introducing the measured n, H
and Ka into the formula G = H  TS = RTlnKa =
RTlnKd, where T is the absolute temperature (295.15 K for
the measurements) and R is the universal gas constant

(8.314 J mol1 K1). The 95% confidence intervals of the
measurements were calculated for the two variables Kd and
H with the one-dimensional error surface projection within
SEDPHAT. The quantity c = Mt(0)Kd
1, where Mt(0) is the
initial macromolecule concentration, ranged between 10 and
600 for all experiments, thus being in a reliable measurement
range (Wiseman et al., 1989).
2.9. Crystallization, data collection and refinement
Crystallization of the FimH lectin was accomplished by the
sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using Crystal Screen
and Crystal Screen 2 from Hampton Research and The PGA
Screen, PACT, MIDAS and 3D Structure Screen from Mole-
cular Dimensions. Co-crystallization conditions of each FimH
structure are given in Table 1, as well as data-processing and
refinement statistics. Data were collected on PROXIMA 1 at
SOLEIL, Saint-Aubin, France and PX14.2 at BESSY, Berlin,
Germany. The structure determination was performed using
molecular replacement in Phaser with ligand-free FimH (PDB
entry 4auu; Wellens et al., 2012) as a model. The ligands were
parameterized using the PRODRG server (Schüttelkopf &
van Aalten, 2004) and the crystal structures were refined using
BUSTER (for low resolution and solvent mask; Smart et al.,
2012) and PHENIX (for high resolution and water picking;
Adams et al., 2002). Geometric evaluation and ’/ backbone
torsion-angle readout were performed using MolProbity v.4.3
(Chen et al., 2010).
2.10. Quantum-mechanical calculations
The Asn135–Ser139 pentapeptide from wild-type FimH and
from the Y137A mutant in complex with HM, as well as the
Asn46–Glu50 pentapeptide from wild-type FimH and from
the Y48A mutant in complex with HM, were extracted from
PDB entries 4buq (WT), 5fs5 (Y137A) and 4ca4 (Y48A),
respectively. Hydrogen atoms were placed and their positions
were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level (for the wild
type) or with 5fs5 (for Y137A and Y48A). Rigid potential
energy surface scans (ten steps of 2.0 in both positive and
negative directions) were performed for the rotation around
the ’ and  dihedral angles of Asn136, Tyr137 (Ala137) and
Asn138 and also Asp47, Tyr48 (Ala48) and Pro49 at the
M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) level. All quantum-mechanical (QM)
calculations were performed using Gaussian 09 (Frisch et al.,
2009).
2.11. Molecular dynamics simulations
All molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories were generated
in the isothermal–isobaric ensemble at 300 K with NAMD2.9
(Phillips et al., 2005) using the CHARMM36 force field
(MacKerell et al., 1998, 2004; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010;
Guvench et al., 2011; Mallajosyula & MacKerell, 2011). Long-
range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the
particle mesh Ewald method (Darden et al., 1993). A
smoothing function was applied to truncate short-range
electrostatic interactions. The Verlet-I/r-RESPA multiple
time-step propagator (Tuckerman et al., 1992) was used to
integrate the equations of motion using time steps of 2 and 4 fs
for short-range and long-range forces, respectively. All bonds
involving H atoms were constrained using the Rattle algorithm
(Andersen, 1983). Missing force-field parameters for BF and
HM were generated with CGenFF (Vanommeslaeghe et al.,
2010). A single 50 ns MD simulation of BF and HM alone in
water was subsequently performed.
The coordinates of the FimH lectin-domain crystal structure
in either its ligand-free state (PDB entry 4auu; Wellens et al.,
2012), bound to HM (Table 1; PDB entry 4buq) or bound to
BF (Table 1; PDB entry 5fwr) were used as initial coordinates.
The Y48A or Y137A mutation was introduced in silico using
the mutate tool of VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996). Each of the
nine systems was solvated and the ionic concentration was
set to 0.15 M NaCl. All ionizable groups were assigned their
standard protonation state as predicted by PROPKA (Bas et
al., 2008). Each molecular system comprised of a total of about
45 000 atoms. The equilibration was performed in three steps:
(i) a 2.5 ns equilibration of the solvent (water and ions), (ii) a
2.5 ns equilibration in which only the protein backbone was
fixed and (iii) an unrestrained 2.5 ns simulation. This was
followed by three independent 50 ns MD production trajec-
tories for each system. In addition, following the same
protocol, two 50 ns production trajectories were generated
using the crystal structures of Y48A and Y137A FimH with
HM bound (PDB entries 4ca4 and 5fs5, Table 1) and of the
Y137A mutant in its ligand-free state (PDB entry 5fx3,
Table 1) to investigate whether the in silico generation of the
mutations had an impact on the simulations.
The backbone dihedral angle values of residues 47–49 and
136–138 were extracted with VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996)
every 2 ps from all trajectories, allowing sufficient data for the
calculation of a dihedral angle distribution. The most abun-
dant conformations of the tyrosine gate were determined by
clustering the trajectories of ligand-free FimH (PDB entry
4auu) using the G_CLUSTER tool from the MD suite
GROMACS (Pronk et al., 2013), based on the root-mean-
square deviation (r.m.s.d.) matrix of the two tyrosine-gate
residues Tyr48 and Tyr137. A total of 15 000 frames was used
for the clustering, extracted every 10 ps using the GROMOS
clustering algorithm (Daura et al., 1999) with a cutoff of 1.5 Å.
The representative FimH configuration of the cluster with the
highest probability was used to screen for protein-residue
interactions using NCIPLOT (Contreras-Garcı́a et al., 2011).
The distance between Ile52 and residues Tyr48 and Tyr137,
respectively, was measured as the distance between the two
centres of mass of all side-chain heavy atoms of each residue.
The flexibility of the HM and BF bound to FimH was assessed
by computing the root-mean-square fluctuation (r.m.s.f.)
difference (r.m.s.f.) of the ligands in the protein compared
with its flexibility in water. The r.m.s.f. is a quantity describing
the movement of each considered atom around the average

As the mannose moiety of both ligands remains in a similar

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The tyrosine-gate mutant Y137A folds more readily
towards a lower energy minimum
In the last ten years, several FimH antagonists have been
rationally designed, synthesized and evaluated for the treat-
ment of E. coli-borne infections (Gouin et al., 2014; Mydock-
McGrane et al., 2016; Klein et al., 2010). These antagonists
consist of a mannose monosaccharide -glycosidically linked
to various, predominantly aromatic, aglycones. The interaction
of the aglycones with the tyrosine gate formed by two tyro-
sines (Tyr48 and Tyr137) at the entrance to the FimH binding
site contributes significantly to their affinity, for example with
a 400-fold increase for HM compared with -d-manno-
pyranoside (Wellens et al., 2012). To experimentally evaluate
the individual contributions of these two aromatic residues,
the corresponding alanine mutants (Y48A and Y137A) were
generated here.
Wild-type FimH and the two mutants were expressed in the
protease-deficient E. coli HM 125, extracted from the peri-
plasm and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1a). Their exact
molecular weights were confirmed by ESI-MS (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1). Identical CD spectrum profiles (Fig. 1b) indicate
that the mutants in the native conformation retain a similar
secondary structure to the wild type (WT). Furthermore, the
stability of the mutants is preserved, as verified by GdmCl-
unfolding experiments. The conformational transition curves
of the WT and the mutants show superimposable profiles, with
similar transition midpoint values (Fig. 1c). The free energy of
folding and the folding cooperativity for the WTand the Y48A
and Y137A mutants indicate that the Y48A mutant is the least
stable protein, with the lowest folding cooperativity, whereas
FimH may even be stabilized by the Y137A mutation
(Table 2).
3.2. The tyrosine-gate FimH mutant Y137A displays a lower
affinity for conjugated mannosides
The relative affinities of WT FimH lectin and the Y48A and
Y137A mutants for AM, HM and BF (Fig. 2), determined by a
competitive binding assay (Rabbani et al., 2010), are reported
as relative inhibition constants (rIC50), with the mannoside
AM as the reference compound (Table 3). Moreover, the
thermodynamic parameters for the binding of AM, HM and

BF to WT FimH and the Y48A and Y137A mutants have been
determined by ITC (Table 3).
In wild-type FimH, the mannosides exhibit largely
enthalpy-driven binding, in agreement with previously
reported results for other monomannoside and oligomanno-
side derivatives (Durka et al., 2011; Wellens et al., 2012) and
for a series of biphenyl -d-mannosides (Fiege et al., 2015;
Pang et al., 2012). The affinity for AM is only slightly reduced
in the mutants compared with the WT, although a decrease in
the enthalpic contribution in Y48A is indicative of a loss of
interactions. Because of the lack of an aglycon on AM, this
reduced enthalpy cannot be understood in terms of a loss of
direct contacts of the ligand with one or both tyrosines. In
Y137A FimH, the enthalpic contribution to binding is further
diminished, which is compensated for by a lower entropic cost,
which is called enthalpy–entropy compensation. This also
shows that although mutation of the tyrosine gate may nega-
tively influence the binding of AM, it remains indifferent as to
which tyrosine is mutated. The Y48A mutation in FimH has a
similar effect on the affinity for HM and BF of FimH, i.e. the
affinity values remain close, within a factor of 2.3–2.6, to those
obtained for wild-type FimH (Table 3). This occurs again
through an enthalpy–entropy compensation effect: the lack of
potential to stack with the Tyr48 aromatic side chain is
resolved by an increased entropic contribution. In stark
contrast, the Y137A mutation results in a dramatic decrease in
affinity towards HM and BF, by a factor of 7.1 and 5.1,
respectively (Table 3). Here, the impact on the enthalpic
change cannot be completely compensated for by a positive
entropic change.
3.3. The crystal structure of ligand-free Y137A reveals an
intrusion into the mannose-binding site and exposes an
unexpected binding site nearby
As a consequence of the Y137A mutation in FimH, the
adjacent lectin domain plugs its polypeptide C-terminal end
into the mannose-binding pocket of one FimH molecule
(Fig. 3a). The Val155-Val156-Pro157-Thr158 peptide of the
FimH lectin domain from an adjacent symmetry-related lectin
domain makes a significant intrusion where the oligomanno-
side glycan is normally bound (Wellens et al., 2008). The
carboxylate group of Thr158 makes a strong hydrogen-bond
interaction (2.5 Å) with Asp54 at the bottom of the mannose-
binding pocket (Fig. 3c). In addition, an EDTA buffer mole-
cule is bound in different alternate conformations into a cavity
on the FimH surface. EDTA is held in place by means of
multiple van der Waals interactions and potentially three
strong hydrogen bonds made by Glu50 (backbone carbonyl at
3.0 Å), Thr53 (side-chain hydroxyl at 2.8 Å) and Asn136 (side-
chain amide group at 2.9 Å) to three different carboxylate
groups of EDTA (Fig. 3b). Remarkably, EDTA was only
contained in the extraction buffer of FimH extraction from the
E. coli periplasm, but remained bound during purification and
dialysis steps, which did not contain EDTA (see also x2). The
EDTA binding site is very close to the mannose-binding
pocket and the two sites are coupled by residue Ile52 (Fig. 3).
The protein backbone holding the mutated residue 137
separates both sites (Fig. 3a). The Y137A mutant structure
allows the binding of a macromolecule other than mannose in
the FimH mannose-binding pocket to be observed for the first
time and moreover exposes a hitherto undiscovered adjacent
binding pocket on the FimH surface.
3.4. Ligand binding in the crystal structures of FimH tyrosine-
gate mutants
Insights into the molecular interactions of the Y48A and
Y137A mutant FimH lectin domains with mannosides are
obtained by solving their X-ray crystal structures either in the
ligand-free form or in complex with the compounds HM or BF
(Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 1). The two new tyrosine-gate mutant
structures showed highly similar backbone conformations,
with an r.m.s.d. for all C atoms of 0.402 Å for Y137A FimH
and 0.368 Å for Y48A FimH relative to the wild-type structure
(PDB entry 4buq), and a similar local binding-site confor-
mations as in the wild type. The overall structure of the FimH
lectin is thus not strongly impacted by the mutations, in
agreement with the CD spectra and unfolding experiments

(Fig. 1). The HM ligand is found to be similarly bound in the
crystal structures of Y137A and WT FimH (Figs. 4a and 3c),
despite the fact that the heptyl aglycone can interact with the
aromatic side chains of both tyrosine-gate residues in WT
FimH and only with Tyr48 in the Y137A mutant. The heptyl
aglycone of HM demonstrates at least two different confor-
mations in the Y48A mutant, of which one penetrates into the
space of the missing Tyr48 side chain (Fig. 4b), as observed by
its shorter distance from the Ala48 mutant residue (3.6 Å
instead of 4.5 and 4.8 Å in Y137A and WT FimH, respectively;
Fig. 4). This disorder of the HM ligand in the Y48A crystals is
congruent with a marked increase in entropic contribution to
the interaction (Table 3). In stark contrast, the binding of BF
to the Y48A mutant is not paired with an increase in entropy
(Table 3). Despite the absence of a crystal structure to provide
insight, the ITC data may indicate that the presence of the
biphenyl aglycone on BF can provide enthalpy-driven inter-
actions with Tyr137 and Ile52 to compensate for the lack of the
Tyr48 aromatic ring. In the crystal structure of the Y137A
FimH mutant in complex with HM the binding site is too
involved in crystal packing to allow the observation of
disorder in the ligand binding (Fig. 4c).
The crystal structure of wild-
type FimH in complex with BF
demonstrates stacking of its
aromatic biphenyl aglycone with
both tyrosines of the gate
(Fig. 4d). BF shows the same
binding mode, ligand conforma-
tion and crystal-packing environ-
ment in each of the eight FimH
monomers, hovering over the
closed tyrosine gate comprised of
Tyr48 and Tyr137, similar to what
is observed for the two FimH
monomers co-crystallized with
BF in a different space group
(P212121; PDB entry 4x50;
Fiege et al., 2015). This same
mechanism of compensation by
aromatic ring substituents does
not hold true for the Y137A
mutant, where a large loss in
affinity is experienced (Table 3).
The lack of the Tyr137 side chain
can thus not be compensated for,
probably because of its larger
distance from the mannose. It has
been documented that the
presence of the Tyr48 side chain
hinders the fit of phenyl -d-
mannosidic compounds into the
binding site, however with an
almost perfect enthalpy–entropy
compensation (Roos et al., 2013).
The steric hindrance by Tyr48
renders the binding highly
dynamic, whereby the aromatic
ligand seeks multiple stacking
modes predominantly with the
two tyrosines, thus including
Tyr137 (de Ruyck et al., 2016). In
conclusion, the absence of the
Tyr137 side chain provokes a
more substantial loss of enthalpy-
driven interactions than the
absence of the Tyr48 side chain
for both HM and BF.

The backbone dihedral angle values of Tyr48 and Tyr137
in the wild-type FimH lectin have always been intriguing,
because their ’ (torsion around the C—N bond) and  
(torsion around the C—C bond) dihedral angles are in a
region of the Ramachandran plot that is not favoured but
allowed (Supplementary Table S2). Remarkably, the ’/ -
angle values of residues 48 and 137 in the alanine-mutant
crystal structures solved here correspond to favoured back-
bone conformations (Supplementary Table S2). These find-
ings, together with the fact that the crystal structures could not
fully explain the ITC measurements, prompted us to investi-
gate the behaviour of the backbone dihedral angles of the
regions containing Tyr48 and Tyr137 by employing molecular
simulation techniques.
3.5. The Y137A mutation relaxes the backbone dihedral
angles
The flexibility of the amino-acid regions 47–49 and 136–138
was assessed using QM calculations in ligand-free FimH by
calculating the relative energies related to the rotation of the
backbone dihedral angles ’ and  of a five-residue peptide

centred either around Tyr48 or Tyr137. These relative energies
of the ’ and  angles upon rotation are plotted for Y137A and
Y48A, using the energy of the angle found in the crystal
structure as a reference, and compared with those of the WT
FimH protein (Supplementary Table S2 and Figs. 5a–5d). Also,
the backbone dihedral angle distributions of the corre-
sponding residues were extracted from the MD trajectories
and analysed (Figs. 5e–5h). As no crystal structures carrying
either the Y48A or Y137A mutation were available for BF, we
generated all MD simulations
from the WT structures after
introducing the mutation in silico
(see x2.11). In addition, MD
simulations were carried out
on the available ligand-free and
HM-bound mutated crystal
structures (see x2.11). In all MD
trajectories the backbone r.m.s.d.
and secondary-structure content
is comparable (Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4) and are in good
agreement with an earlier MD
simulation on WT FimH (Singa-
ravelu et al., 2014). This finding
prompted us to use the trajec-
tories of proteins featuring in
silico mutations for further
analysis.
The relative QM energy plots
show that the mutation of Tyr137
to alanine results in a relaxation
of the backbone dihedral angles
of residue 137 and of the adjacent
Asn136 (Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c).
Rotating around these dihedral
angles in the Y137A mutant
FimH causes a much smaller
energy penalty compared with
WT FimH, thus allowing these
dihedral angles to sample a much
broader range of values. The
dihedral angle distribution
extracted from the MD trajec-
tories shows a similarly increased
flexibility, allowing a wider
sampling range of the dihedral
angle values of Asn136 in the
Y137A mutant compared with
WT FimH (Figs. 5e, 5f and 5g).
For the Y48A FimH, the
mutation does not alter the shape
of the energy curve in all but one
case (Supplementary Fig. S4): the
’ angle of residue 48 (Fig. 5d; to a
smaller extent, the  dihedral
angle curve of residue 49 also is
flatter; see Supplementary Fig.
S4a). Its rotation to a higher dihedral angle value causes a less
severe energy penalty compared with wild-type FimH. These
results largely agree with the dihedral angle distribution
obtained from the MD trajectories (Supplementary Fig. S5),
showing that the mutation of Tyr48 impacts the distribution of
the Asp47 ’/ and the Tyr48 ’/ dihedral angles (Fig. 5h and
Supplementary Fig. S5), while leaving the other backbone
dihedral angles unchanged in this region. It appears that the
residues surrounding Tyr48 stabilize its position and more

angle, the probability hxi of finding the dihedral angles at a certain value is plotted.
greatly restrict its freedom to change conformation, compared
with Tyr137 that is located in a loop near the protein surface
(Fig. 3a).
To summarize, the Y137A mutant samples a wider range of
dihedral angles with lower energy than WT FimH, whereas at
position 48 the sampling range of dihedral angles is restricted
upon mutation to alanine. The energy level of the Y48A
mutant is less impacted compared with the WT, congruent
with the low impact of this mutation on the affinity of FimH
towards BF and HM (Table 3).
3.6. Backbone dynamics of Tyr48 and Tyr137 are coupled by
the mannose-binding residue Ile52
The analysis of the MD trajectories highlights that the
Y137A mutation impacts the ’/ dihedral angle of Tyr48 on
the opposite side of the tyrosine gate, while leaving the other
backbone dihedral angles in the region 47–49 unchanged
(Fig. 5h and Supplementary Fig. S5b). In addition, the Y48A
mutation also impacts the ’/ dihedral angles of residue 136
and the  angle of Tyr137 (Supplementary Fig. S5a). This can
be explained if the motions of Tyr48 and Tyr137 are connected
to each other. Indeed, in the most populated Tyr48 and Tyr137
configurations (Fig. 6a) both aromatic rings interact with Ile52,
through which a connection between the two tyrosines can be
established. The probabilities that the centre of mass between
Ile52 and Tyr48 and between Ile52 and Tyr137 are at a certain
distance (Fig. 6b), analysed on the full-length WT trajectories,
further highlights an Ile52-mediated coupling of the motion of
Tyr48 and Tyr137. Ile52 has previously been identified to make
hydrophobic contacts with the C2—C3 bond of bound -d-
mannose (Gouin et al., 2014).
The interaction between Tyr137 and Ile52 (in Y48A) and
between Tyr48 and Ile52 (in Y137A) is weakened by the

The motions of Tyr48 and Tyr137 are coupled, mediated by Ile52. (a) The five major clusters of the tyrosine gate are shown extracted from the MD

the WT Tyr48 and Tyr137 show a clear preference for being close to Ile52 (a distance of the two centres of mass of <6 Å), indicating an Ile52-mediated
coupling of the motion in the tyrosine gate. This connection is weakened (Y48A) or lost (Y137A) following mutation of these residues.

the gate is liberated to move freely. The weakening is more
pronounced for the Y137A mutation. The Ile52-mediated
connection might be needed in WT FimH for proper guidance

linking the protein-intruded mannose-binding site inside the

Asn136, Thr53 and Glu50 at the protein surface (Fig. 3).
3.7. The ligand-free state of Y137A FimH samples backbone
dihedral angles of the mannose-bound state of wild-type
FimH
The backbone ’/ dihedral angle distributions of most of
the residues in the 47–49 and 136–138 regions in wild-type
FimH protein show a shift in the maximum upon the binding
of HM or BF (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). This
shift is lost in the Y137A mutant for most of the dihedral
angles in the region of residues 136–138 (Fig. 7 and Supple-
mentary Figs. S6 and S7). In Y137A, the backbone dihedral
angle distributions of residues 136–138 in the unbound state
already resemble the distributions in the bound state. In the
Y48A mutant, the backbone dihedral angle distributions of
residues 47 and 48, but not of Pro49, undergo a change
(Supplementary Fig. S7). The effect of the mutation is less
pronounced for the Y48A mutant compared with the Y137A
FimH, in which almost all of the angles were impacted
(compare Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7).

Flexibility of ligands bound to WT FimH and the Y48A and Y137A mutants compared with the situation in water alone. The difference in flexibility for
the WT (black), Y48A (green) and Y137A (blue) FimH MD trajectories (given as the r.m.s.f.) is plotted for the ligands (a) HM and (b) BF against the
heavy-atom name of the ligand atoms. In addition, the ligand is depicted with atom names above each plot. The most representative conformation of (c)
the HM ligand (cyan) and (d) the BF ligand (orange) is depicted for the trajectories with the lowest r.m.s.f. values (HM, WT; BF, Y48A). The protein is
shown as a white cartoon; residues 48 and 137 are shown as ball-and-stick models and coloured atomwise.

Figure 9
The different processes identified to play a role in the change in FimH affinity for binding (a) HM and (b) BF upon mutation of one of the tyrosine-gate
residues. Both the results from the ITC measurements (Table 3) and from the molecular simulation (MD and QM; see xx3.5–3.8) are summarized.
This indicates that in wild-type FimH the 136–138 region
undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding,
whereas in the Y137A mutant no conformational change takes
place. Such a conformational change can lead to a loss of
energy that normally would go into the binding of the ligand.
It can be hypothesized that the high energy and geometric
stringency inherent to the binding pocket of wild-type FimH
has been optimized to enhance interactions with the ligands
and to direct selective and specific binding with high affinity
(Table 3).
3.8. Ligand dynamics are differently impacted by the
tyrosine-gate mutations
As the binding might also impact the flexibility of the
ligand, we computed the difference in flexibility of the ligand
in water and in the protein (Fig. 8). The binding of HM to
wild-type FimH largely restricts its flexibility (Fig. 8a). The
restriction is a little less pronounced in the Y48A mutant and
is even further softened in the Y137A mutant. In contrast to
HM, the flexibility of BF is almost not restricted in the WT
binding site and also not in the Y137A mutant. In the case of
the Y48A mutant the flexibility of BF is largely restricted
compared with its flexibility in water (Fig. 8b). The largest
decrease is found for the second aromatic ring of the BF
aglycon part. This lower flexibility arises from a T-shaped
stacking between the second aromatic ring of BF and the
Tyr137 aromatic ring observed in most of the Y48A MD
simulation snapshots (Fig. 8c) that is absent in the wild-type
and Y137A MD simulations. This stacking could not have
been predicted from the crystal structure of WT FimH in
complex with BF, which shows aromatic stacking with Tyr48
only (Fig. 4d), but it may explain why there is such a little loss
in the enthalpic contribution for BF binding in Y48A FimH
(Table 3).
3.9. Molecular effect of the mutations on HM and BF binding
The objective of this study is to assess the contributions of
the tyrosine-gate residues to the binding of mannosides to the
FimH lectin domain. We have therefore generated two single-
residue mutants, Y48A and Y137A, in FimH. No significant
global secondary-structure differences are shown by CD and
unfolding experiments, or in the crystal structures and MD
simulations. However, the binding affinities obtained by a
competition assay and a thermodynamic assay show a large
impact of the Y137A mutation, whereas the affinities are only
minimally affected for the Y48A mutation. Interactions and
dynamics are related to the enthalpic and entropic contribu-
tions to the reaction, respectively. The Y48A mutation has
some, but a smaller, effect on the different studied parameters
and the ensemble adjusts more easily to these changes, in
accordance with the enthalpy–entropy compensation seen in
ITC measurements. The thermodynamic fingerprints of the
Y137A, on the other hand, showed reduced enthalpic contri-
butions that are only partially compensated by enhanced
entropy contributions (Table 3). The impact of the Y137A
mutation cannot be remediated and thus the affinity of FimH
is decreased.
The crystal structures indicate changes in the backbone
dihedral angles owing to the mutation, which are confirmed
by QM and MD simulations. A summary of the different
processes is given in Fig. 9: (i) in the ligand-free state the
dynamics of the 136–138 region are increased owing to the
Y137A mutation; (ii) in contrast the flexibility of the 47–49
region is reduced (MD data) or unchanged (QM) in the case
of the Y48A FimH mutant; (iii) the motions of Tyr137 and
Tyr48 are coupled by Ile52, and each of these residues can
move more freely after mutation of the other; (iv) a confor-
mational change of the 136–138 region takes place in wild-type
FimH upon binding of the ligand and this change is largely lost
in the Y137A mutant, but only slightly in the Y48A mutant;
(v) the dynamics of the HM ligand are restricted upon binding
to wild-type FimH and both tyrosine mutations increase the
flexibility of HM in the binding site and, finally, (vi) such a
restriction is not observed for the binding of the BF ligand
to wild-type FimH; however, in the Y48A FimH mutant a
decrease of the dynamic behaviour of BF is observed in the
binding site through the formation of compensating inter-
actions (Figs. 8b and 8d).
In conclusion, this study highlights the need to combine
several theoretical and experimental methods to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of the changes in binding affinity of
FimH upon mutation and can be seen as a case study for
further investigations.
4. Conclusion
In this work, we present novel crystal structures of the FimH
lectin with mutations in the tyrosine gate, namely of tyrosines
48 or 137 to alanine. The mutations have a moderate effect on
the affinity of FimH for mannose, but a markedly lower affi-
nity is observed for heptyl- and biphenyl-substituted manno-
sides that intercalate in the tyrosine gate. In the crystals of the
Y137A mutant, a breakdown of the binding site with a severe
loss of specificity is observed. Using quantum-mechanical
calculations, we could demonstrate that the wild-type Tyr137
introduces strain in the polypeptide backbone. This maintains
a high energetic potential that is normally only released upon
the binding of an oligomannosidic ligand. Using molecular-
dynamics simulations, we could highlight that this energetic
potential is coupled to the other tyrosine of the gate, Tyr48,
via the inner mannose-binding residue Ile52. In conclusion,
the mutation of Tyr137 to alanine relaxes the binding site
prematurely, whereby the stringent selectivity of the FimH
lectin for mannose is disrupted and the binding affinity
decreases.
