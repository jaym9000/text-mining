Abstract
Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) are small helical protein domains that adopt the Greek key
fold. For the two CARDs studied to date, RICK-CARD and caspase-1-CARD (CP1-CARD), the
proteins unfold by an apparent two-state process at equilibrium. However, the folding kinetics are
complex for both proteins and may contain kinetically trapped species on the folding pathway. In the
case of RICK-CARD, the time constants of the slow refolding phases are consistent with proline
isomerism. RICK-CARD contains three prolines, P47 in turn 3, and P85 and P87. The latter two
prolines constitute a nonconserved PxP motif in helix 6. To examine the role of the prolines in the
complex folding kinetics of RICK-CARD, we generated seven proline-to-alanine mutants, including
three single mutants, three double mutants, and one triple mutant. We examined the spectroscopic
properties, equilibrium folding, binding to CP1-CARD, and folding kinetics. The results show that
P85 is critical for maintaining the function of the protein and that all mutations decrease the stability.
Results from single mixing and sequential mixing stopped-flow studies strongly suggest the presence
of parallel folding pathways consisting of at least two unfolded populations. The mutations affect the
distribution of the two unfolded species, thereby affecting the population that folds through each
channel. The two conformations also are present in the triple mutant, demonstrating that interconver-
sion between them is not due to prolyl isomerism. Overall, the data show that the complex folding
pathway, especially formation of kinetically trapped species, is not due to prolyl isomerism.

Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) play important
roles in apoptosis, transcription activation, and inflamma-
tion (Li and Yuan 1999; Martin 2001). CARDs are mem-
bers of the death domain (DD) superfamily, which
includes the DD, the CARD, the pyrin domain (PyD),
and the death effector domain (DED) (Hofmann 1999;
Fairbrother et al. 2001; Weber and Vincenz 2001). These
protein domains consist of,100 amino acid residues that
form six a-helices folded into a Greek key topology
(Vaughn et al. 1999). The biological function of the do-
main is to convey signals to downstream effectors (Hof-
mann 1999; Weber and Vincenz 2001; Shi 2002; Shiozaki
et al. 2002). CARDs are found as part of selected protein
kinases, procaspases, and adaptor proteins. For example,
RICK (CARDIAK, RIP2; RIP-like interacting CLARP
kinase) contains an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase
catalytic domain and a C-terminal CARD (Thome et al.
1998). The CARD of RICK (RICK-CARD) is involved

in CD95 (also called Fas)-initiated apoptosis, the activa-
tion of JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and NF-kB, and
initiation of inflammatory responses. RICK-CARD inter-
acts with the CARD of procaspase-1 (CP1-CARD),
which results in caspase activation and subsequent cleav-
age of interleukin-1b and interleukin-18 (Inohara et al.
1998; McCarthy et al. 1998; Thome et al. 1998). RICK
also is considered a key therapeutic target for bacterial-
induced inflammation (Jeyaseelan 2002).
The members of the CARD family have an identical
topology, a unique a-helical Greek key fold, and similar
three-dimensional structures (Day et al. 1999; Vaughn et
al. 1999; Zhou et al. 1999), although the amino acid
sequence identity is low in general (Druilhe et al. 2001;
Lee et al. 2001; Weber and Vincenz 2001). While they
fold into a complex topology, the Greek key, CARDs are
amenable to examination by a number of biochemical and
biophysical techniques (Vaughn et al. 1999; Zhou et al.
1999; Chen and Clark 2003, 2004), and we have suggested
that CARDs are good models for studies of the folding of
homologous proteins (Chen and Clark 2004). In these
studies, the goals are to examine the roles of amino acid
sequence identity and structural topology on the conserva-
tion of folding pathways (Plaxco et al. 1998, 2000; Guna-
sekaran et al. 2001; Mirny and Shakhnovich 2001). We
showed that the folding of theCARDsofRICK(Chen and
Clark 2003) and of procaspase-1 (CP1-CARD) (Chen and
Clark 2004) are describedby an apparent two-state process
at equilibrium, while the folding and unfolding kinetics are
quite complex. The folding rate is several orders of magni-
tude slower than predicted by the contact order (Plaxco et
al. 1998) or the long-range order (Gromiha and Selvaraj
2001), and this is due, in part, to the apparent formation of
kinetically trapped species during folding.
RICK-CARD consists of 95 amino acids (Mr=10,917
Da) and contains one tryptophan (helix 1), two tyrosines
(helices 3 and 6), and a single phenylalanine (helix 5) but no
disulfide bonds or prosthetic groups.While the equilibrium
unfolding occurs without apparent intermediates, the con-
formational free energy of RICK-CARD is only ,3 kcal/
mol (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, 1 mMDTT, 25C). Kinet-
ically, RICK-CARD refolds through several intermediate
states, and the relaxation times (t1–t3) of the observed
kinetic phases are 32 msec, 1 sec, and 83 sec, respectively
(Chen and Clark 2003). In addition, the kinetics of unfold-
ing in 4Murea-containing buffers demonstrate four phases
(burst, t1=1 sec, t2=12 sec, t3=71 sec). The burst phase
intermediate in unfolding retains ,70% of the conforma-
tional free energy of the native ensemble, and the fast
phases of refolding (32 sec-1) and of unfolding (0.13 sec-1)
in the absence of denaturant represent the major folding
reactions in terms of burial of hydrophobic surface area.
Otherwise, the nature of the intermediates is unknown
currently. We speculated that proline isomerism might be
the sourceof the slow reactions observed in refolding and in
unfolding since the apparent rates of the slow phases are
independent of the final urea concentration, and the relaxa-
tion times are consistent with proline isomerism (Chen and
Clark 2003). RICK-CARD contains three prolines (P47,
P85, P87), including a nonconserved PxP motif in helix 6
(Fig. 1). Although the proline residues are predicated to be
in trans in homologymodels of the protein structure (Chen
andClark 2003), we cannot rule out the possibility that one
or more of the proline residues reside in the cis configura-
tion.While the role of cis/trans proline isomerism in kinetic
complexity has been well established for other proteins
(Brandts et al. 1975; Schmid 1983; Kiefhaber et al. 1990a;
Bhuyan and Udgaonkar 1999; Reader et al. 2001), the
specific role of the proline residues in the kinetic complexity
of RICK-CARD is unknown.Our previous results showed
that the native ensemble is not directly accessible from the
unfolded ensemble (Chen and Clark 2003, 2004); thus, the
protein unfolds and refolds through at least one intermedi-
ate conformation. We suggested that one or more of the
intermediates may be kinetically trapped species. To exam-
ine these issues, we generated seven proline-to-alanine
mutants of RICK-CARD, consisting of three single
mutants (P47A, P85A, P87A), three double mutants
(P47A/P85A, P47A/P87A, P85A/P87A), and one triple
mutant (P47A/P85A/P87A).
Results and Discussion
General spectroscopic properties of the RICK-CARD
mutants
The fluorescence emission spectra of the mutants are
either unchanged or slightly red-shifted compared with
that of the wild type (data not shown). In general, the
emission maximum is ,328 nm when the protein is

excited at 280 nm and is ,330 nm when excited at 295
nm. The mutations of P85 to alanine and of P47/P87 to
alanine had the largest effects on the fluorescence emis-
sion, as the maximum was red-shifted to ,335 nm when
the samples were excited at 280 nm (data not shown),
indicating that the aromatic residues are more exposed
to solvent. This is consistent with the near-UV circular
dichroism (CD) spectra described below.
The near-UV and far-UV CD spectra of the seven
mutants are shown in Figure 2 and are compared to
those of wild-type RICK-CARD (dashed lines in each
panel). In general, the far-UV CD signals decreased for
all mutants, demonstrating that the mutations were
structurally perturbing. In the far-UV, P87A (Fig. 2C)
was the least disruptive to the secondary structure,
whereas the triple mutant (Fig. 2G) was the most

disruptive. Note that the triple mutant, P47A/P85A/
P87A, is referred to as P3A.
In the near-UV, P87A was again the least structurally
perturbing (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the removal of P85
(Fig. 2B) resulted in the loss of near-UV signal such
that it was similar to that of unfolded wild-type RICK-
CARD (cf. with short dashed line in Fig. 2A). This was
true also of the double mutant P47A/P87A (Fig. 2E).
The double mutant P85A/P87A (Fig. 2F) and the triple
mutant, P3A (Fig. 2G), each retained only residual sig-
nals in the near-UV. Overall, the data show that removal
of any proline is structurally perturbing, although the
structure is perturbed to different degrees. In the single
mutants, P85A is the most disruptive to the structure,
whereas in the double mutants the combination of P87A
with either P47A or P85A results in large changes in
near-UV CD signal. It is interesting to note that replac-
ing the PxP motif in helix 6 with a sequence that is more
conducive to forming a helix, AxA, results in significant
disruption of the asymmetric environment of the aro-
matic residues, which presumably correlates with a dis-
ruption of the tertiary structure. This suggests that the
PxP motif in helix 6 is important for maintaining tertiary
contacts that stabilize interactions between helix 6 and
helix 1 and/or helix 5 (Fig. 1).
Effects of proline substitutions on binding to CP1-CARD
We previously characterized the interaction between wild-
type RICK-CARD and CP1-CARD by monitoring
changes in tryptophanyl fluorescence emission upon com-
plex formation, as CP1-CARD lacks tryptophans (Chen
and Clark 2004). In those studies we obtained an equilib-
rium dissociation constant of 1.4 mM, which is consistent
with that determined for the interactions of Tube with
Pelle, two CARD-containing proteins (Schiffmann et al.
1999). Using the same binding assay, we determined that
all of the variants were able to bind CP1-CARD except
P85A and P85A/P87A (data not shown).
Stability of the RICK-CARD mutants
To determine the effects of the substitutions on protein
stability, we examined the urea-induced equilibrium un-
folding of the RICK-CARD mutants by monitoring
changes in fluorescence emission and far-UV CD in the
presence of urea-containing buffers (Fig. 3). Two probes
were monitored in the case of fluorescence emission. Sam-
ples were excited at 280 nm to monitor the fluorescence
emission of tryptophanyl and tyrosinyl residues, or samples
were excited at 295 nm to monitor tryptophanyl fluores-
cence emission. It has been shown that folding intermedi-
ates may show different fluorescence emission properties
with use of these two probes (Clark et al. 1993; Bose and
Clark 2001). The equilibrium folding of wild-type RICK-
CARD is well described by an apparent two-state
folding mechanism (DGH2O=3.06 0.1 kcal mol-1,
m=1.276 0.06 kcal mol-1 M-1 at pH 8 and 25C) (Chen
and Clark 2003), and representative data are shown in
Figure 3 for comparison with the mutants. The results
show that two mutants (P87A and P85A/P87A) are
described by an apparent two-state equilibrium folding
process. In agreement with the CD spectra (Fig. 2), which
show a loss in secondary structure, the proteins are less
stable than is wild-type RICK-CARD. The mutation of
P87 to alanine (Fig. 3C) was the least perturbing
(DGH2O=2.46 0.1 kcal mol-1, m=1.596 0.08 kcal
mol-1 M-1 at pH 8 and 25C), although the m-value is
significantly larger than that of wild-type RICK-CARD.
Overall, the data for this mutant are consistent with a well-
formed native structure in the absence of denaturant. This
agrees with the far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 2) that showed
theP87Asubstitution tobe the least perturbing. In addition,
a two-state process best described the data for the dou-
ble mutant, P85A/P87A (DGH2O=1.26 0.1 kcal mol-1,
m=0.626 0.08 kcal mol-1 M-1 at pH 8 and 25C) (Fig.
3F); however, the large urea-dependent baseline in the pre-
transition suggests that the native ensemble consists of a
mixture of native and non-native conformations. This also
agrees with the CD spectra (Fig. 2), which show a decrease
in secondary and tertiary structure for this mutant.
The data for the remaining mutants are not well
described by a two-state folding process. A pretransition
baseline is not observed for the P85A single mutant (Fig.
3B), the P47A/P85A (Fig. 3D) and P47A/P87A (Fig. 3E)
double mutants, or the P3A triple mutant (Fig. 3G). This
suggests that the native structure is not well formed and
that partially folded structures exist in the absence of
urea. In addition, an inflection is observed at ,2.5 M
urea, demonstrating the formation of a stable intermedi-
ate. While the results can be fit to a three-state equilib-
rium folding model (N. I.U), it is difficult to
determine with any accuracy the conformational free
energy of the first transition (N. I). As described by
Eftink (1994), for cases with a strongly urea-dependent
slope to the pretransition baseline, assuming that the
initial signal is due entirely to native protein, generally
leads to an overestimation of the conformational free
energy and m-value. Determining the stability of these
mutants would require quantifying the population of
non-native species as well as other biophysical param-
eters, such as the quantum yield, since the fluorescence
emission is proportional to the population of macro-
states. Qualitatively, however, the presence of non-
native structure is in agreement with the changes in
fluorescence emission described above, where a red-
shift in the emission spectrum was observed. The loss
of secondary and tertiary structure observed by CD (Fig.

2) as well as the results of the equilibrium unfolding data
(Fig. 3) show that these mutations are destabilizing.
The proline substitutions affect the kinetics of refolding
and unfolding
As described previously, four kinetic phases are ob-
served during the unfolding of wild-type RICK-CARD
(Chen and Clark 2003). A burst phase represents forma-
tion of an intermediate that retains ,70% of the native
stability and buried hydrophobic surface. Following the
burst phase, three kinetic phases are observed with time
constants of 1 sec, 12 sec, and 71 sec. The two slower
phases are independent of the final urea concentration,
and as described below, the fast phase represents the
major phase of unfolding. While the results have been

described elsewhere (Chen and Clark 2003), the data are
shown in Figure 4H for comparison with the RICK-
CARD mutants. Overall, the data for the mutants show
that unfolding appears to be complete within the dead-
time for mixing (Fig. 4). In all cases, upon mixing with
either 4 M or 6 M urea-containing buffers, the signals

match those of the unfolded protein controls within ,2
msec and do not change beyond this initial signal. This
shows that regardless of the proline substitution, the
intermediates that occur during unfolding of wild-type
RICK-CARD have been destabilized so that unfolding
of the mutants occurs rapidly. It should be noted, how-
ever, that the single tryptophan in helix 1 is partially
exposed to solvent and may report on the rapid unfolding
of helix 1 and/or helix 6. We also note that the proteins
were excited at 280 nm in the fluorescence assays, which
excites the tryptophanyl and tyrosinyl residues (helices 3
and 6), so the probes should report on the global unfold-
ing of the protein. At this point, however, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the probes report on the rapid
unfolding of local structures.
Under strongly native conditions, four phases are
observed in the refolding of wild-type RICK-CARD.
The data are shown here for comparison with the
RICK-CARD mutants (Fig. 4H), although they have
been described elsewhere (Chen and Clark 2003). A
burst phase is observed within the dead-time for mixing,
and the amplitude encompasses 65% of the total change
in fluorescence emission. Based on a linear response of
the burst phase amplitude to final urea concentration, it
was inferred that the burst phase does not correspond to
formation of a folding intermediate. As described below,
however, the proline mutants suggest that an intermedi-
ate does form in the burst phase. Following the burst
phase, three kinetic phases are observed with time con-
stants (t1–t3) of 32 msec, 1 sec, and 83 sec (see Table 1).
The first of these three phases represents the major fold-
ing phase in terms of burial of hydrophobic surface.
While the rate constant of the second phase has a strong
negative dependence on the final urea concentration and
is not observed at urea concentrations >1.2 M, the rate
constant of the third phase is independent of the final
urea concentration (Chen and Clark 2003). The relative
amplitudes of the three phases are 16%, 2%, and 17%,
respectively (Table 1).
Based on their refolding properties, the RICK-CARD
proline mutants can be grouped into two categories. In the
first category, theburst phase is observedand is followedby
at least one additional kinetic phase (see Table 1). The
mutants in this category are P47A (Fig. 4A), P87A (Fig.
4C), P47A/P85A (Fig. 4D), and P3A (Fig. 4G). In the
second category, only the burst phase is observed during
refolding. The mutants in this category are P85A (Fig. 4B),
P47A/P87A (Fig. 4E), and P85A/P87A (Fig. 4F). In cate-
gory I, the refolding of P47A (Fig. 4A) is characterized by a
burst phase and two observable phases. For this mutant,
the burst phase encompasses ,75% of the total change in
fluorescence emission and is followed by the fast phase
(A1=23%, t1=29 msec) and the intermediate phase
(A2=2%, t2=8.3 sec) (Table 1). The difference in the
time constant for the intermediate phase compared with
that of wild-type RICK-CARD (8.3 sec vs. 1 sec) likely
results from the strong negative urea dependence of this
phase and the difference in final urea concentrations for the
two experiments (0.54 M vs. 0.36 M). Removal of P47
results in the loss of the slow phase of refolding; however,
this is true for all of the RICK-CARD mutants (Fig. 4;
Table 1). For the other proteins in category I (P87A, P47A/
P85A, and P3A), the burst phase is followed by the fast
phase, and the intermediate and slow phases are not
observed (Table 1). It should be noted, however, that the
amplitudeof the intermediate phase is small (2%–3%of the
total fluorescence change), so itwouldbe difficult to discern
this phase if the amplitude were decreased in the mutants.
ForP87A, the amplitude of theburst phase is similar to that
of wild-type RICK-CARD (,65%), and the remaining
amplitude is accounted for in the fast phase. For the double
mutant P47A/P85A and the triple mutant, the burst phase
accounts for 85%–90% of the total change in fluorescence
emission, with the fast phase accounting for the remaining

amplitude. In category II, refolding appears to be complete
within the dead-time for mixing as the burst phase encom-
passes 100% of the total change in fluorescence emission
(Fig. 4; Table 1). There were no further changes in fluores-
cence emission from,2 msec to 100 sec of refolding.
The amplitudes of the burst phases of refolding and of
unfolding were monitored as a function of final urea
concentration, and the results are shown in Figure 5.

experiments. The kinetic data also are compared to the
results from the equilibrium unfolding experiments (the
experiments are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized by the
solid lines in Fig. 5). The data show that the burst phase
amplitudes are distinct from those of the final signal only
for P47A (Fig. 5A) and P87A (Fig. 5C). In general, if the
burst phase amplitude was greater than,85% of the total
change in fluorescence emission, then it is difficult to
distinguish between the initial and final signals of refold-
ing. For the two single mutants, P47A (Fig. 5A) and P87A
(Fig. 5C), the response of the burst phase amplitude to
increasing urea concentration is linear, as it is for the wild-
type protein, except that it clearly is not a continuation of
the unfolded baseline. This suggests that the burst phase
represents the formation of a partially folded conforma-
tion that has marginal stability and low cooperativity of
unfolding. The results for the other mutants suggest that
equilibrium occurs rapidly since the signals obtained from
the kinetic studies are similar to those from the equilib-
rium folding data. The kinetic data suggest that the reac-
tions have reached equilibrium within ,100 msec;
however, as we show later, the reactions reach a true
equilibrium after ,20 sec. In these experiments the data
were collected for a maximum of 10 sec, which may
explain why in some cases the kinetic amplitudes do not
overlay with the equilibrium data at intermediate urea
concentrations (for example, see Fig. 5D).
In addition to the burst phase amplitudes, the rate
constant of the fast phase for refolding was determined
at several final urea concentrations for the category I
proteins, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The
data were fit as described (Jackson and Fersht 1991;
Ferguson et al. 1999) to determine the rate of refolding
in the absence of urea (kUN) and mU-TS, which reflects
the change in solvent accessible surface area between the
unfolded and transition state ensembles. The results
show that the values of mU-TS are similar, from 0.8 to
0.9 kcal mol-1 M-1 (Table 1). This suggests that, as for
the wild-type RICK-CARD, the fast phase represents
the major refolding phase in terms of burial of hydro-
phobic surface.
Sequential mixing experiments
We employed sequential mixing (double jump) refolding
experiments to monitor the appearance of slow-folding
species under denaturing conditions (Brandts et al. 1975;
Kiefhaber et al. 1990b). In these experiments, the native
protein is unfolded in urea-containing buffer for various
times (delay time), and then the protein is returned to
buffer and allowed to refold (N!U (delay)!N)
(Schmid 1986). The refolding trace following the second
mix is monitored experimentally (U!N). For wild-type
RICK-CARD, the burst, fast and slow phases observed
in the single mixing experiments (Fig. 4) could be mon-
itored following return of the protein to native condi-
tions, whereas for P87A RICK-CARD, the burst and
fast phases were monitored. Representative data are
shown in Figure 6.

Proline substitutions in RICK-CARD
One should note that the data in Figure 6A are repre-
sented as the fluorescence emission signal, whereas those
in Figure 6C are the amplitudes of the fast or slow
phases. That is, the raw traces were fit to one or more
exponentials, and the amplitudes obtained from the fits
are plotted versus unfolding delay time in Figure 6C.
The fluorescence signals in Figure 6A change as the
burst phase signal goes from that of the unfolded protein
toward that of the native protein. The data shown in
Figure 4H, plotted as fraction unfolded (%), show that
the refolding burst phase encompasses ,65% of the
total signal change (see also Table 1), and the amplitudes
of the fast and slow phases encompass 16% and 17%,
respectively, of the total signal change. The signals
shown in Figure 6 are consistent with these values. For
example, using the maximum amplitudes for the fast and
slow phases (0.0045) and the change in fluorescence
emission of the burst phase (0.075 - 0.048=0.027) yields
a total change in fluorescence emission of 0.036 (0.027+
0.0045+0.0045). Thus, under these conditions, the burst
phase encompasses 75% of the total change in fluores-
cence emission, and the fast and slow phase amplitudes
each represent ,13% of the total change in fluorescence
emission.
No burst phase amplitudes were observed for P87A or
wild-type RICK-CARD unless the proteins were
unfolded for >10 sec (Fig. 6A). For both proteins, the
results show that at short unfolding delay times, the
signal remains that of the unfolded protein when the
protein is shifted to native conditions. The longer the
protein is unfolded, the more the burst signal goes to the
native amplitude upon refolding. This occurs with a
half-time of ,20 sec for P87A or ,45 sec for wild-type
RICK-CARD (Fig. 6B). While the single mixing studies
(Fig. 4) suggest that P87A unfolds rapidly (<2 msec),
the results shown here demonstrate that the protein
cannot refold unless it is unfolded for >10 sec. Follow-
ing this time, the burst phase amplitude appears and
reaches a maximum in ,50 sec (>200 sec for wild-type
RICK-CARD). In addition, during the short unfolding
times (delay times #20 sec), the fast phase in refolding is
not observed for either protein (Fig. 6C); however, the
slow refolding phase is observed for wild-type RICK-
CARD (Fig. 6C) and appears with a half-time of 30–40
sec. Thus, for wild-type RICK-CARD, at delay times of
20–30 sec, only the burst and slow refolding phases are
observed upon refolding. For P87A, only the burst
phase is observed.
For P87A, longer times of unfolding (>50 sec) result
in a second phase upon refolding in which the burst
phase signal decreases. This occurs with a half-time of
,200 sec (Fig. 6A). These results strongly suggest that
the unfolded ensemble consists of two slowly intercon-
verting forms. As the second conformation is populated,
the amplitude of the burst phase decreases. Similar
results were obtained for P47A, P47A/P85A, and P3A
except that the change in amplitude of the second phase
was smaller than that for P87A (data not shown).
As shown in Figure 6C, the appearance of the fast
phase of refolding correlates with the second amplitude
change observed in the burst phase. At unfolding delay
times >30 sec, the fast refolding phase is observed when
the protein is shifted to native conditions, and the ampli-
tude reaches a maximum when delay times are >500 sec
(t1/2, 200 sec). This shows that the second population of
the unfolded ensemble is associated with the fast refold-
ing phase. The same is true for wild-type RICK-CARD
since the fast phase is observed only after extended times
of unfolding. A similar analysis could not be performed
with the other category I proteins because the ampli-
tudes of the fast phase were too small to be observed in
this experiment.
In the case of the category II mutants, changes in the
burst phase signals were similar to that of P87A, except
that the second transition was not observed (data not
shown). The half-times for the transition (or the first
phase in the case of the category I proteins) are shown
in Figure 6B.
These results are not expected when the native con-
formation is directly accessible from the unfolded
ensemble (N .U) nor are they observed when proline
isomerism occurs in the unfolded state (N.U1.U2).
In the latter case, results of the double jump experiment
show a large population of native protein (N) at the
short delay times and a decreasing population of N at
longer delay times due to equilibration between U1 and
U2 (Odefey et al. 1995; Mayr et al. 1996; Kiefhaber et al.
1997; Pappenberger et al. 2001).
Overall, the data shown in Figure 6 suggest that the
proteins fold through parallel channels in which at least
two unfolded species slowly interconvert (t1/2,200 sec in
4.8 M urea). Furthermore, the results suggest that the
mutations affect the partitioning of the unfolded ensem-
ble, which in turn affects the concentrations of species
that fold through each channel. The results indicate that
the fast and slow refolding phases, observed in single
mixing studies, are each associated with one channel.
In addition to the double jump experiments, we also
performed sequential mixing unfolding experiments,
also known as interrupted refolding (Schmid 1983; Pap-
penberger et al. 2001). In these studies, protein that had
been unfolded in urea-containing buffer is rapidly mixed
with buffer in order to return the protein to conditions
favoring the native conformation. Following various
times of refolding (delay time), the protein is returned
to urea, and the signal is monitored (U!N
(delay)!U). Overall, this technique provides details
on the refolding pathway because it is assumed that the
404 Protein Science, vol. 15
Chen and Clark
native conformation represents the thermodynamically
most stable conformation. If this is the case, then inter-
mediates that form during refolding will be unstable and
will unfold faster than the population of native protein
that has formed (Pappenberger et al. 2001). In this
experiment, the amplitudes should represent the popula-
tion of native protein, and the signal traces will be
similar to those of the single mixing experiments only
when the native conformation is formed. It was shown in
Figure 4 that unfolding appeared to be very rapid for
each of the mutants as the signal overlays that of the
unfolded control within 10 msec of unfolding. Because
of this, formation of the native conformation could be
observed only by monitoring the burst phase signal as a
function of the refolding time since there were no observ-
able kinetic phases. Similar results have been described
for CP1-CARD, where it was shown that the protein
unfolds very rapidly (Chen and Clark 2004). For the
wild-type protein, one should be able to monitor four
phases in unfolding, as described above. In the experi-
ments described below, we were able to monitor three of
the four phases. We note that the two slower rates differ
by less than a factor of ten, so the slow phase observed in
this experiment may represent both phases. The inter-
rupted refolding experiments were performed with P87A
and P3A, as representative of the mutants, and the
results were compared to those of wild-type RICK-
CARD (Fig. 7).
As shown in Figure 7A, at short refolding delay times
the signal remains that of the native protein when the
protein is shifted to unfolded conditions. The longer the
protein is refolded, the more the burst signal goes to the
unfolded amplitude upon unfolding. For wild-type
RICK-CARD, no native protein is observed unless the
protein has been refolded for ,100 sec, and as shown in
Figure 7, A and B, the three observable phases appear at
the same time. In comparison, the mutants must be
refolded for ,10 sec before the native conformation is
attained. Surprisingly, following short delay times, the
signal did not return to that of the unfolded conformation
when the protein was returned to the urea-containing
buffer. As described previously for RICK-CARD (Chen
and Clark 2003) and CP1-CARD (Chen and Clark 2004),
the results suggest that an alternate native-like species
forms at short refolding delay times that slowly intercon-
verts to the correct native conformation at long refolding
delay times. This correct native conformation unfolds as
predicted from the data seen in Figure 4. Overall, the
results show that the wild-type protein is fully folded
after ,200 sec (t1/2, 150 sec), whereas the mutants are
fully folded after ,80 sec (t1/2, 30 sec).
The single mixing experiments (Fig. 4) show fully
native wild-type RICK-CARD after 100 sec of folding,
whereas the interrupted refolding studies show that only
,20% of the protein is native at 100 sec of refolding.
For the mutants, the results in Figure 4 suggest that the
native conformation is reached after 1 sec of refolding,
whereas the results in Figure 7 show that there is little
native conformation populated at refolding times <10
sec. Together, these data suggest that there may be two
native conformers of the proteins and that the intercon-
version between the conformers is slow.
Proposed model for folding of RICK-CARD
We previously suggested a sequential folding model for
RICK-CARD (Chen and Clark 2003). In that model, the
unfolded protein folds through two intermediates prior to
forming the native conformation (U! I1! I2!N). The
fast refolding phase (Table 1, t1), where most of the
hydrophobic surface area is buried, is represented by the
U! I1 transition; the intermediate phase (Table 1, t2) is
represented by the I1! I2 transition; and the slow phase
(Table 1, t3) is represented by the I2!N transition. In

tical value, and are presented to guide the eye.

Proline substitutions in RICK-CARD
light of the data presented here for the seven proline-to-
alanine substitution mutants of RICK-CARD, the results
are difficult to reconcile with a sequential folding model.
They are, however, consistent with folding via parallel
channels. The results suggest that the unfolded ensemble
consists of at least two populations, U1 and U2. The
results indicate that the two unfolded conformations
interconvert slowly, with a half-time of ,200 sec in 4.8
M urea (Fig. 6), although folding occurs rapidly from
both unfolded forms to yield non-native species. Results
from the double jump experiments (Fig. 6) suggest that
the fast and slow refolding phases for wild-type RICK-
CARD, which are observed in the single mixing studies
(Fig. 4), occur in separate channels since the slow phase
appears at shorter delay times. From our data it is not
clear how many non-native species reside in each channel.
For example, the intermediate refolding phase (t=1 sec)
is not observed in the double jump experiment, likely
because the amplitude of the phase is very small. This
phase could represent the transition of an intermediate
to the native conformation, or it could represent a transi-
tion between the two channels. It is clear, however, that
neither unfolded species folds directly to the native con-
formation. Thus, at present we cannot assign the inter-
mediate or slow phases to specific transitions in the
folding pathway.
The presence of two native conformers is suggested by
the interrupted refolding studies (Fig. 7), where it was
observed that the native conformation formed at times
much longer than those suggested by the single mixing
experiments (Fig. 4). Based on results from sequential
mixing stopped-flow studies, we suggested that an inter-
mediate that forms during refolding represents a mis-
folded, or kinetically trapped species (Chen and Clark
2003). That is, when RICK-CARD is refolded for a
short time, it forms a native-like species that slowly
isomerizes to the correct native conformation. It is not
yet clear whether the second native conformer suggested
by the interrupted refolding studies (Fig. 7) is the native-
like kinetic trap described previously.
Theprolinemutations appear to affect thedistributionof
unfolded conformers, which, in turn, affects the observed
folding kinetics in the single mixing studies. For example,
the single mutant P85A and the double mutants P47A/
P87A and P85A/P87A, that is, the category II proteins,
primarily populate one unfolded conformation because
the fast refolding phase is not observed for these mutants.
The category I proteins, P47A, P87A, P47A/P85A, and
P3A, are similar to wild-type RICK-CARD in that both
unfolded conformers are populated, and folding occurs
from both channels. Consequently, the fast refolding
phase is observed for these proteins. The mutations affect
the distribution of the populations of the unfolded confor-
mers to varying degrees, and this affects the population of
protein that folds through each channel. For example, for
P87Aa relatively larger population folds through the chan-
nel that contains the fast refolding phase compared to P3A,
since there is a larger amplitude for this phase in P87A.
Other models may also be invoked to explain the
sequential mixing studies and cannot be ruled out at
this point. For example, the loss of secondary and ter-
tiary structure resulting from the mutations (Fig. 2), the
lower stability (Fig. 3) and the stabilization of partially
folded intermediates at equilibrium (Fig. 3) suggest that
some amount of non-native, and possibly unfolded, pro-
tein species is present under native-like conditions. If this
were true, then the loss of kinetic phases during refold-
ing, as observed in the category II proteins, may be due
to the inability of these mutants to fully form the native
conformation.
Conclusions
The following general conclusions can be drawn from
the data presented here. First, P85, in helix 6, is critical
for maintaining the function of the protein. At present, it
is not clear how this region of helix 6 affects the binding
site for CP1-CARD since this site consists primarily of
helices 2 and 3 of RICK-CARD. Second, all of the
mutations destabilize the protein. Third, the mutations
increase the rate of unfolding. Intermediates that are
observed during unfolding of wild-type RICK-CARD
are not observed for the mutants. Fourth, the results
suggest the presence of parallel folding channels consist-
ing of at least two conformations in the unfolded ensem-
ble. The mutations affect the distribution of populations
of unfolded species. Fifth, the mutations affect the rate
of refolding. The results show that the native conforma-
tion forms two to three times faster in the mutants than
in wild-type RICK-CARD. Overall, the data presented
here demonstrate that the interconversions between the
two unfolded or the two native conformers are not due
to proline isomerism. In addition, the data show that the
kinetic complexity in forming the a-helical Greek key is
not due to prolyl isomerism, at least in the case of
RICK-CARD. This is shown by the triple mutant,
P3A, which lacks prolines but retains the two folding
channels. At present, it is not clear what causes the two
unfolded or native populations or the slow isomeriza-
tions that occur during folding and unfolding.

b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), DEAE Sepharose, Q-
Sepharose, and ampicillin were purchased from Sigma. All buf-
fers were filtered through either 0.45- or 0.22-mm filter mem-
branes. Urea stock solutions (10 M) were prepared as described
previously (Pace et al. 1989) in a buffer of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8) and 1 mM DTT. The urea concentration of each stock solu-
tion was calculated by weight and by refractive index, and the
solution was used only if the two values were within 61%.
Plasmid construction
Single proline mutants of RICK-CARD (P47A, P85A, and
P87A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Strata-
gene) using pCARD-RICK (Chen and Clark 2003) as the
template in PCR amplification. The PCR primers used for
mutagenesis were the following. The primer sequence
for P47A was 5¢-CTTGTTAGTACTAAGGCTACAAGGA
CCTC-3¢. In this mutant, a unique ScaI restriction site was
created (underlined in the above sequence). The resulting gene
contains a silent mutation at the third base for the codon of
threonine 45, which is shown in bold. The mutated base for
P47A is shown in italics. The primer sequence for P85A is
5¢-CAAATGGGTCTGCAGGCTTACCCG-3¢. A unique PstI
restriction site was created (underlined in the above sequence).
A silent mutation at the third base of leucine 83 is generated
and shown in bold. The mutated base for proline 85 to alanine
is shown in italics. The primer sequence for P87A is 5¢-GGG
TCTCAGCCATATGCGGAAATACTTGTGG-3¢. Two silent
mutations (in bold) were made in order to incorporate an NdeI
restriction site (underlined) that was used for screening clones.
The mutated base for proline 87 to alanine is shown in italics.
Double mutants of RICK-CARD include P47A/P85A,
P47A/P87A, and P85A/P87A. The plasmid P47A/P85A was
produced by using the primers for P85A (shown above) and the
plasmid for the single mutant P47A as template for site-di-
rected mutagenesis. In the resulting double mutant, two unique
sites, ScaI and PstI, were generated. The plasmid P47A/P87A
was generated by using the primers for P87A and the plasmid
of the single mutant P47A as template. Two unique sites, ScaI
and NdeI, were generated. The plasmid P85A/P87A was gen-
erated by using the primer 5¢-GGGTCTGCAGGCATATGC
GGAAATACTTGTGG-3¢ for site-directed mutagenesis and
plasmid pP87A as the template. Two unique sites, PstI and
NdeI, were generated.
The triple mutant, P47A/P85A/P87A, or P3A, was con-
structed by using plasmid P85A/P87A as template and the
primers for P47A in site-directed mutagenesis. Again, the
ScaI site was used for screening. All constructs were sequenced
(both strands) to confirm the sequences.
Protein purification
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed with
the plasmids of the mutants individually and used for protein
purification. The mutants P47A, P85A, and P85A/P87A were
purified using protocols described previously for RICK-CARD
(Chen and Clark 2003). The P47A/P85A, P47A/P87A, and P3A
proteins were purified using protocols described for RICK-
CARD (Chen and Clark 2003) but with the following modifica-
tions. Cells were grown in LBmedia at 37C until the absorbance
at 600 nm reached 0.6. The cultures were then induced with 0.8
mM IPTG and grown overnight at 20C. The proteins were
present in inclusion bodies. P87Awas purified using the protocol
described previously (Chen and Clark 2003) except for the fol-
lowing modifications. After washing and dissolving the insoluble
fraction in ,8 M urea-containing buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl at
pH 8, 1 mM DTT), the dissolved protein was centrifuged at
14,000 rpm, 4C for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered
through 0.45-mm filter membrane. The protein solution was
loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (3.2· 14 cm) equilibrated
with 4 M urea-containing buffer A. A linear gradient of 0–400
mM NaCl in 4 M urea-containing buffer A (400 mL total
volume) was used to elute the protein. The flow rate was ,4
mL/min. P87A eluted at ,100 mM NaCl. The pure protein
fractions were pooled and concentrated. P87A was refolded in
ice-cold buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl at ,0.5 mg/mL by
either the rapid dilution described for RICK-CARD (Chen and
Clark 2003) or by dialysis.
Fluorescence emission and CD spectroscopy
Fluorescence emission spectra of the mutants of RICK-CARD
were obtained by exciting the proteins (3 mM) at 280 or 295
nm, and the emission spectra were measured from 300 to 400
nm (PTI C-61 spectrofluorometer, Photon Technology Inter-
national). All spectra were corrected for buffer signals. The
experiments were maintained at a constant temperature of
25C using a circulating water bath. CD spectra were obtained
with a J600A spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) at a constant
temperature of 25C using a circulating water bath. The path
length of the CD cells used was 0.1 cm (far-UV) or 1 cm (near-
UV). All spectra were corrected for buffer signals. For far and
near-UV CD, the protein concentrations of P47A, P85A,
P87A, P47A/P85A, P47A/P87A, P85A/P87A, and P3A were
23.7, 17.3, 38.9, 19.2, 45.4, 10.5, and 28 mM, respectively. All
proteins were in buffer A.
Equilibrium folding/unfolding
Equilibrium folding/unfolding studies were performed either
with a titrator (Olis Inc.) or by manual mixing. Stock solutions
of native RICK-CARD mutants, 3 or 6 mM, were prepared in
buffer A for both fluorescence and CD measurements. Stock
solutions of unfolded protein were prepared in the same buffer
containing 6 M urea. Both stocks (native or unfolded protein)
contained the same protein concentration and were incubated
at room temperature for at least 30 min prior to the experi-
ments. A titrator (Olis Inc.) was used for equilibrium folding
studies by fluorescence emission, and an incubation time >30
min was used after each titration. It was determined that this
time is sufficient to allow for equilibration. Samples were
excited at 280 or 295 nm, and fluorescence emission was mon-
itored from 300 to 400 nm. All samples were incubated at 25C.
The emission spectrum at each urea concentration was
examined as described previously (Royer et al. 1993) to deter-
mine the average emission wavelength, Ælæ, using Equation 1,
<> ¼

where Ii is the fluorescence emission signal at wavelength li.
For the CD experiments, titrations were performed manually
by mixing unfolded protein with the native protein. A quartz
cuvette with 1-cm path length was used in these experiments,
where the signal at 220 nm was measured for 120 sec, and the
data were averaged and corrected for background signals.

Proline substitutions in RICK-CARD
The normalized average emission wavelengths and the nor-
malized CD data were plotted versus urea concentration, and
the data were fit globally either to a two-state equilibrium
process (N.U), described by Santoro and Bolen (1988), or
to a three-state model (N. I.U) (Fu and Liang 2002). The
program IgorPro (Wavemetrics Inc.) was used in the global
fits, and the uncertainties described in the text derive from the
fits. For data that exhibited a strongly urea-dependent pretran-
sition baseline, indicating the presence of non-native structure
in the absence of urea, the native baseline slope was fixed to
that of the wild-type protein. All other parameters were
allowed to vary in the fits.
Single-mixing stopped-flow fluorescence experiments
Single-mixing kinetic experiments were performed using a
stopped-flow spectrofluorometer (SX.18MV, Applied Photo-
physics). The temperature was controlled at 25C using a
circulating water bath. The samples were excited at 280 nm,
and the fluorescence emission was measured using a cutoff
filter of 305 nm.
Refolding experiments were performed by mixing stock pro-
tein solutions (33 mM) that had been prepared in buffer A
containing either 4 M urea for P87A or 6 M urea for the other
mutants. The final protein concentration was 3 mM, and a
mixing ratio of 1:10 was used. For measures of the burst phase
amplitude, stock protein (33 mM) in either 4 M or 6 M urea-
containing buffer A was mixed with buffer A containing urea
between 0 and 4 M, as shown in the figures. For unfolding
experiments, stock protein (33 mM) in buffer A was mixed with
buffer A containing urea between 0 and 4 M. The final protein
concentration was 3 mM, and a mixing ratio of 1:10 was used.
The final urea concentrations are shown in the figures. The
refolding traces were fit to a sum of exponentials (one to
three), as described previously (Chen and Clark 2003).
Double jump stopped-flow experiments
Sequential mixing double jump experiments were performed
using the sequential mixing mode of the stopped-flow spectro-
fluorometer, as described previously (Chen and Clark 2003).
The temperature was held constant at 25C. In general, the first
jump was performed with a mixing ratio of 1:1 using two buffer
solutions, described below. After a specified delay time, the
solution from the first jump was rapidly mixed with a third
solution using a mixing ratio of 1:5. Incubation (delay) times
from 0.1 to 900 sec were used after the first jump.
Double jump experiments of the RICK-CARD mutants,
except P87A, were carried out as described previously (Chen
and Clark 2003) with the following modifications. Native pro-
tein (36 mM) in buffer A was mixed with buffer A containing
9.6 M urea for the first jump. After various delay times, as
described in the text, the protein solution was mixed with
buffer A for the second jump. The signal trace of refolding
from the second jump was monitored. The final protein con-
centration was 3 mM, and the final urea concentration was 0.8
M. The control signal of the native protein was determined
from a solution containing protein at 3 mM in 0.8 M urea-
containing buffer A. The control signal of the unfolded protein
was obtained by a solution containing protein at 3 mM in 4.8
M urea-containing buffer A. Conditions for the double jump
experiments for P87A were the same as those described pre-
viously (Chen and Clark 2003).
Interrupted refolding experiments
Conditions for interrupted refolding experiments for the
RICK-CARD mutants, except P87A, were similar to those
described previously for wild-type RICK-CARD (Chen and
Clark 2003). The first jump was performed with a 1:10 mixing
ratio, and the second jump used a mixing ratio of 1:5. Unfolded
protein (99 mM) in buffer A containing 5 M urea was mixed
with buffer A for the first jump. After various delay times, as
shown in the figures, the protein solution was mixed with
buffer A containing 6 M urea. After the first jump, the urea
concentration is 0.454 M. After the second jump, the urea
concentration was 5 M, and the final protein concentration
was 1.5 mM. The signal for the unfolded protein was obtained
from the final signal of the experiment that used a 100 second
delay time. To obtain the signal of the native protein, the third
solution was changed to buffer A, as described (Chen and
Clark 2003). Conditions for the interrupted refolding experi-
ments for P87A were the same as those described previously
(Chen and Clark 2003).
