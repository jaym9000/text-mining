Abstract
Fast-folding WW domains are among the best-characterized systems for comparing experiments 
and simulations of protein folding. Recent microsecond-resolution experiments and long (totaling 
milliseconds) single-trajectory modeling have shown that even mechanistic changes due to 
mutation in folding kinetics can now be analyzed. Thus, a comprehensive set of experimental data 
would be helpful to benchmark the predictions made by simulations. Here, we use T-jump 
relaxation in conjunction with protein engineering and report Φ values as indicators for folding 
transition state structure for 65 side chain, 7 backbone hydrogen bond and 6 loop 1 deletion and/or 
insertion mutants of the 34-residue hPin1 WW domain. 45 cross-validated consensus mutants 
could be identified that provide structural constraints for transition state structure within all 
substructures of the WW domain fold (hydrophobic core, loop 1, loop 2, β sheet). We probe the 
robustness of the two hydrophobic clusters in the folding transition state, discuss how local 
backbone disorder in the native state can lead to non-classical ΦM values (ΦM > 1) in the rate-
determining loop 1 substructure, and conclusively identify mutations and positions along the 
sequence that perturb the folding mechanism from loop 1-limited towards loop 2-limited folding.

Introduction
WW domains are β sheet modular protein domains of 30–65 residues in length that modulate 
specific interactions with proline-rich protein ligands. WW domains have proven to be an 
excellent model for ultrafast folding experiments, for mechanistic experimental studies on 
the folding of a simple β sheet structure, and for benchmarking computational folding 
scenarios [1–3].
The best characterized natural WW domains to date are the hPin1 WW domain from human 
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 [3], and the FBP28 WW domain from formin-
binding protein 28 [4], with limited data available for a third WW domain, the hYAP65 WW 
domain from human Yes-Kinase associated kinase [5]. Mutational ΦM value analysis 
suggest that formation of loop 1 in WW domains is mostly rate limiting (ΦM values > 0.80) 
[6].
In FBP28 WW and hYap65 WW, the N-terminal loop 1 sequence folds into a 5-residue type-
I G-bulge turn, the statistically preferred conformation among WW domains. The longer, 
intrinsically disordered 6-residue loop 1 in hPin1 WW appears to have been selected for 
function. Its unusual loop conformation (type II-turn intercalated in a 6-residue loop) may 
position the side chains of residues S16 and R17 for optimal ligand binding [7]. Replacing 
the hPin1 loop 1 with the turn of FBP28 WW to make the FiP WW domain increases 
stability by up to 7 kJ/mole and speeds up folding from ~ 80 µs to ~ 13 µs, but compromises 
function [7]. A similar frustration of folding by function has also been observed in other 
cases, such as frataxin [8].
For WW domains with their loop 1 substructure optimized for folding thermodynamics and 
kinetics, formation of loop 2 becomes competitive as the rate-limiting step for folding. 
Indeed, further optimization of the loop 2 sequence in FiP (FiP N30G/A31T/Q33T, FiP-GTT 
hereafter) produced a WW domain with a folding relaxation time of ~ 4 µs, approaching the 
speed limit for folding [9].
Here we report an in-depth study of temperature jump kinetics for 78 mutants of the hPin1 
WW domain (Table 1) that also includes data from two more limited, previous Φ value 
analyses [6, 7, 10, 11]. 45 mutants were amenable for ΦM value analysis, providing energetic 
constraints for structural mapping of the folding transition state of hPin1 WW. Multiple side

chain substitutions at some key sequence positions (e.g. within the hydrophobic cores or 
loop 2) allow us to calculate error-weighted average ΦM values that are more likely to be a 
robust representation of transition state vs. native state free energy changes than single (e.g. 
Ala) substitutions. We also identify substitutions that are not suitable for ΦM value analysis, 
and discuss the reasons. This approach has been used by Davidson and co-workers to 
investigate ‘conservatism’ of substitutions at several sites of the SH3 domain [12].
Although wild type hPin1 WW and its variants fold more slowly than the redesigned loop 1 
variant FiP, their folding rates are still in the microsecond range that is now within the reach 
of fast folding simulations. As computation of folding in the 50–500 µs range becomes 
feasible, we believe that the data presented in this study will prove to be a rich resource for 
detailed comparisons, providing constraints on mechanisms and rate changes deduced from 
molecular dynamics simulations, which are still debated in the literature [9, 13–15].
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
After a brief review of hPin1 WW structure and native state interactions (Fig. 1, section 1), 
we begin our discussion of the results in section 2 with the mutational phi-value (ΦM) 
analysis, focusing on which mutants are likely to be reliable reporters for transition state 
structure (Fig. 2). Next, a temperature-dependent phi-value (ΦT) analysis is used in section 3 
to identify mutations that perturb the folding mechanism and whose perturbing effect 
escapes detection by inspection of the mutational ΦM values only (Fig. 3). The consensus set 
of 39 non-perturbing mutants with reliable ΦM values is employed in section 4 to analyze 
the transition state structure of hPin1 WW (Figs 4–7). Section 5 looks at various loop 1 
insertion and deletion variants within the rate-limiting loop 1 substructure (Fig. 8). A 
hypothetical “hybrid” ΦM map for the ultrafast folding hPin1 WW variant FiP (Fig. 9) to 
benchmark recent molecular dynamics simulations concludes the paper.
1. Overview of hPin1 WW structure and native state interactions
Two types of interactions help stabilize and specify the three-stranded β sheet structure of 
the hPin1 WW domain. The first type is mediated by the side chains of conserved 
hydrophobic residues that form two segregated hydrophobic clusters, one on each side of the 
β sheet (Fig. 1a). The second type of interaction involves a network of 10 backbone-
backbone and 4 backbone-side chain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1b).
Hydrophobic cluster 1 is formed by the side chains of residues L7, P8, W11, Y24 and P37. 
The N-terminal Trp (W11 in hPin1 WW) and the C-terminal Pro (P37 in hPin1 WW) are 
absolutely conserved in WW domains. Mutation of residues W11, Y24 and P37 to Ala or 
Leu in hPin1 WW results in partially unfolded, or fully unfolded protein, even at low 
temperature (4° C) (Fig. 1c and [10]). As hydrophobic cluster 1 does not contribute to ligand 
binding, these medium-long range side chain interactions appear to have evolved to 
maximize thermodynamic stability of hPin1 WW, rather than its biological function.
Hydrophobic core 2 lies on the ligand-binding face of the three-stranded β sheet, and is 
formed by the side chains of residues R14, Y23 and F25 (Fig. 1a). These residues are only 
moderately conserved in WW domains, presumably because hydrophobic core 2 contributes

to ligand binding. Ala mutations of residues 14, 23 and 25 in hPin1 WW, although severely 
destabilizing the native state (ΔΔGf ~ 9 kJ/mole) (Fig. 1c), allow folding into the native state 
structure under the most favorable folding conditions (4 °C).
Using amide-to-ester mutagenesis, we showed that the degree of destabilization of the native 
state upon eliminating a backbone hydrogen bond is strongly context-dependent [16]. 
Hydrogen bonds near the two loop substructures are less influential than hydrogen bonds 
that are protected within a hydrophobic core. The side chain amino group of N26 (β strand 
2) forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of P9 and to the indole ring of 
W11, thus linking β strands 1 and 2 of the three-stranded β sheet. Like the hydrophobic core 
1 residues (W11, Y24 and P37 in hPin1 WW), the Asn in strand 2 (N26 in hPin1 WW) is 
highly conserved among WW domains and N26A or N26L mutations unfold hPin1 WW 
(Fig. 1c) [10].
2. ΦM-value analysis
The mutational ΔΔGf†/ΔΔGf) quantifies changes in the free energy of activation (ΔΔGf†) 
relative to the ground state free energy of folding (ΔΔGf) between wild type and mutant 
proteins [17, 18] Computational modeling of ΦM values is now possible for WW domains 
[14, 19], making direct comparisons with experiments achievable.
To obtain accurate ΦM values that truly represent transition state energetics, one must design 
non-disruptive mutants that differ sufficiently in thermodynamic stability from the wild type 
reference protein [20–23], but are not so different that the folding landscape is substantially 
altered. A generally accepted strategy for ΦM value analysis is to use conservative 
hydrophobic deletion mutations (e.g. Ile/Leu → Val → Ala ; Thr → Ser; Phe → Leu → 
Ala). This strategy avoids mutants that increase side chain size or introduce new functional 
groups (i.e. Ser → Thr, Phe → Trp), as well as mutation of solvent-exposed charged residues 
with long-range electrostatic interactions and/or protein-solvent interactions (e.g. Glu → 
Ala, Tyr → Phe). Several of the mutations that we employed in our previous side chain ΦM 
analysis of hPin1 WW [6] do not meet these requirements. This has been discussed in detail 
in the literature [22].
One in four mutants studied here has a thermodynamic stability very close to wild type 
hPin1 WW (ΔΔGf < 1 kJ/mole, ΔTm < 2.5 °C, with a typical error in Tm of 0.5 – 1 °C). 
These mutants were excluded from the ΦM analysis discussed herein. Their thermodynamic 
and kinetic data (Table 1) should nonetheless provide a valuable resource for benchmarking 
upcoming molecular dynamics simulations because most of these mutants fold on the 
microsecond to millisecond time scale, accessible to all atom explicit [24], implicit [14] and 
coarse grained simulations [25]. We calculated ΦM values at three representative 
temperatures (50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C) (Table 1), where experimental data was available for 
almost all mutants without the need for error-prone extrapolation. For some of the more 
stable loop 1 deletion variants, we only report ΦM values at 55 and/or 60 °C.
Outliers in the analysis—At 55 °C, the ΦM values of the mutants that potentially qualify 
for ΦM analysis (ΔΔGf < 1 kJ/mole and ΔTm < 2.5 °C) range from −0.20 (L7I) to 2.56 
(S16A) (Fig. 2A, Fig. 2B, Table 1). With the exception of some loop 1 mutants that only

slightly destabilize the domain, there is no correlation between the magnitude of a ΦM value 
and the extent of destabilization (ΔΔGf in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). Except for mutants E12Q, 
I28A, and Y23F, the estimated error in ΦM was less than 10 %. A surprisingly high fraction 
of mutants yield ΦM values that lie outside the classical range of ΦM values (in particular 
ΦM > 1). Almost all mutants with non-classical ΦM values map to the hydrophobic core 1 
and loop 1 substructures in native hPin1 WW, pointing to the importance of these 
substructures for transition state energetics. Mutant L7I yields the only negative ΦM value, 
which is, however, not supported by the L7A and L7V mutations (Fig. 2A). Also the large 
ΦM value of V22A (β strand 2) can neither be cross-validated by ΦM values of immediate 
sequence neighbors (R21A/H, Y23L/A) nor by its cross-strand neighbor (M15A, β strand 1). 
Finally, the ΦM value of Y23F is almost twice as high as the ΦM values of Y23L and Y23A 
that target the same residue (Fig. 2A). Y23F deletes a solvent-exposed hydroxyl-group that 
should not affect the side chain packing of hydrophobic core 1. Its unusual ΦM value most 
likely reports on changes in solvation, rather than packing of the core. Mutants L7I, V22A 
and Y23F were thus excluded from further analysis.
Probing key residues for stability by multiple mutations—Several residues critical 
for thermodynamic stability, i.e. R14, Y23 and F25 that constitute hydrophobic core 2 (Fig. 
1a), and T29 in loop 2 of hPin1 WW (Fig. 1b), were probed by multiple mutations (vertical 
ΦM analysis). We find excellent agreement between the ΦM value of the non-conservative 
mutants R14F/L and the classical R14A mutant, and the ΦM values of the Leu and Ala 
mutants of F25 differ by 0.10 units (Fig. 2a, Table 1). This is clear evidence that 
hydrophobic cluster 2, although moderately conserved among WW domains, is rather robust 
towards perturbation by single side chain modifications.
Loop 2 of hPin1 WW is formed by residues H27-N30, and adopts a αR-αR-αR-αL, or παL-
conformation, with the first three residues being in a right-handed helical conformation, and 
N30 being in a left-handed helical conformation. The παL-conformation is very common 
among four residue loops and is also found in the homologous hYap65 and FBP28 WW 
domains. We probed the contribution of T29 to transition state structure and energetics by 
the three classical mutations T29S/A/G. The non-conservative T29D mutation was also 
included in the analysis, as T29D is found in the homologous hYap65 WW domain, and 
T29D was utilized in our first ΦM analysis study of hPin1 WW [6].
The ΦM value of T29A (0.49 ± 0.01) is closest to the error-weighted average ΦM value 
(0.53), with T29D yielding a slightly lower value (ΦM = 0.44 ± 0.01) while T29S (ΦM = 
0.69 ± 0.02) and T29G (ΦM = 0.79 ± 0.01) yielded higher values. Of all these, only the 
glycine mutant lies more than a standard deviation from the average. We also studied a 
double-mutant, I28N/T29G, which replaces the base of the helical παL-turn with a sequence 
(Asn-Gly) that has a high propensity to form a tight 4-residue type-I’ turn, a common loop 
type seen in hairpin structures. I28N/T29G is one of the most destabilized loop 2 mutants 
(ΔΔGf = 8 kJ/mol) and has a large ΦM value (0.96 ± 0.01). The larger ΦM value shows that 
loop 2 can become rate limiting when destabilized, moving the transition state towards the 
native state. As shown in the next section (ΦT analysis), mutants T29G and I28N/T29G are 
perturbing mutants in that they shift the folding transition state with respect to wild type

hPin1 WW, so both mutants are not reliable reporters of the unperturbed wild type transition 
state structure.
Perturbation of hydrophobic cluster 1 disrupts the folding transition state—
Molecular dynamics simulations of the fast-folding FiP variant of hPin1 WW suggest that 
hydrophobic cluster 1 is only weakly formed in the transition state. The simulated ΦM values 
for hydrophobic core 1 residues (L7: −0.30 ± 0.50, P8: −0.3 ± 0.1, W11: ~ 0.4, Y24: 0.32 
± 0.1, P37: ~ 0) suggest that the native W11-Y24 side chain interaction is partially 
developed in the folding transition state, while other hydrophobic core contacts (e.g. P37 
sandwiched between W11 and Y24 (SI Fig. 1)) must develop after crossing the folding 
barrier [17, 26, 27].
Because of its importance for stability (Fig. 1c), hydrophobic cluster 1 proves to be difficult 
to map experimentally by ΦM analysis. Even though the negative ΦM value of L7I (within 
error) agrees with the value from simulations, its ΦM value is not supported by L7A and 
L7V mutations. Mutating residues W11, Y24 and P37 to either Ala or Leu resulted in 
unfolded proteins. Mutants P8A, W11F and Y24W, although (severely) destabilized, unfold 
cooperatively upon heating but yield non-classical ΦM values significantly higher than the 
ΦM values of other hydrophobic core 1 mutations (L7I/A/V, G10A, Y24F). As the W11F 
mutant of hPin1 WW folds into a native-like structure with a rigid core (SI Fig. 2), and 
because the conservative W11F mutation is unlikely to perturb unfolded state structure 
significantly, the high ΦM value of W11F most likely results from a perturbation of 
transition state energetics, rather than ground state effects. The Y24W mutation replaces the 
phenol-moiety of Y24 with the indole ring of Trp. The larger side chain enables “gain-of-
interactions” in the denatured and transition state ensembles, as well as steric clashes in the 
native state that are not present in the wild type protein. The ΦM values of mutants G10A 
(0.57 ± 0.02) and Y24F (0.68 ± 0.02) agree reasonably well with simulation, but we 
observed that neither mutation is ideal for transition state mapping. Surface-exposed G10 
acts as a hinge residue in hydrophobic core 1 formation, so it does not contribute to the side 
chain packing of the hydrophobic core per se, and Y24F removes a solvent-exposed OH-
group without perturbing the side chain packing of the core (SI Fig. 1). Like Y23F in 
hydrophobic core 2, its ΦM value may primarily report on changes in protein solvation 
energetics, rather than genuine hydrophobic core contacts. Unlike the disruptive mutations 
P8A, W11F and Y24W, mutants G10A and Y24F were included in further analysis.
In summary, the large number of disruptive hydrophobic core 1 mutants, the strong effect of 
the W11F mutation on the hPin1 WW folding kinetics, and the intermediate ΦM values of 
the non-disruptive mutants L7A/V/I, G10A and Y24F, suggest that while hydrophobic 
cluster 1 is only partially structured in the transition state, it is very important for protein 
stability.
Non-classical ΦM values in loop 1—The intrinsically dynamic loop 1 substructure of 
hPin1 WW (SI Fig. 3) was probed by both side chain and backbone hydrogen bond 
mutagenesis. Mutation S16s deletes the backbone hydrogen bond between residues S16 and 
R21, while mutation R17r weakens, but does not eliminate, the backbone hydrogen bond

between residue S16 and S19 (Fig. 1b). Mutants S16G, S19G, S18G/S19G and G20A 
perturb the native state by changing the backbone entropy.
Supporting our previous hypothesis that loop 1 formation is rate-limiting for hPin1 WW 
folding, all ten loop 1 mutants exhibit high ΦM values close to or larger than 1 (Fig. 2B). The 
highest ΦM values were calculated for mutants S16A (2.56 ± 0.02) and S16T (1.78 ± 0.02). 
The ΦM value of S16A is about twice as high as that of all other loop 1 mutants, and is a 
clear outlier. From the structure of the folded hPin1 WW domain it is not immediately 
obvious why S16A would perturb transition state energetics and slow down folding so much, 
but similar observations have been made with the fynSH3 domain [28], where a T47A 
substitution produces a ΦM value twice as high as that of T47S and T47G.
Mutants S16G, R17r, S19G, S18G/S19G and G20A all share ΦM values > 1 (ΦM = 1.14–
1.43). Mutants S16G, R17r and G20A are significantly less stable than S19G and S18G/
S19G, so at least their non-classical ΦM values cannot be attributed to artifacts due to small 
differences in the stability between wild type and mutant proteins (ΔΔGf). ΦM values close 
to 1 are obtained for side chain mutants R21A/H (loop 1/β strand 2 interface) and for mutant 
S16s that eliminates the backbone hydrogen bond between residues S16 and R21 that closes 
the 6-residue loop conformation. Except for S16A and S16T, all these mutants are used for 
further analysis.
3. ΦT-value analysis
In folding studies that employ chemical denaturants (urea, guanidine hydrochloride) as the 
perturbation, transition state locations can be calculated from an analysis of the V-shaped 
folding relaxation rate vs. denaturant concentration plot, also known as “chevron plot.” The 
Tanford βT value from this analysis is an indicator of the relative compactness of the folding 
transition on the reaction coordinate in terms of solvent accessible surface area [29]. Using 
temperature as perturbant by analogy [6, 30, 31], a mutant’s ΦT value 
( ) can be used as a quantitative, entropic reaction coordinate that 
describes how much the transition state shifts along the reaction coordinate because of the 
mutation. It is worth emphasizing that the ΦT value reports on the overall changes in entropy 
(i.e. it also includes changes in protein solvation), not just protein conformational entropy. 
Because the ΦT value is calculated from two derivatives, it is also sensitive to the quality of 
the raw data with the best results obtained at temperatures close to the midpoint of unfolding 
(Tm).
We first calculated ΦT values directly by taking the derivatives of the second order Taylor 
series in Table 1. Some of the quadratic coefficients have larger errors than others, and this 
results in unphysical values of ΦT (SI Fig. 4A), of the temperature of maximal stability T0 
(where ΔG is at a minimum), and of heat capacities. We therefore also analyzed the data by 
Taylor series expanding the free energy around the temperature of maximal stability using 
ΔG = ΔG0 + ΔG(2) (T-T0)2. This “ΦT T0-fit” yields essentially the same ΦM values as the 
Taylor expansion about Tm in Table 1 (SI Fig. 4B), and ΦT values with more realistic T0 for 
all proteins, so we opt to discuss the “ΦT Tm-fit” throughout this paper. For completeness, 
we summarize the connection between the Taylor expansion and the common Gibbs-

Helmholtz expansion (in terms of the more physical parameters ΔH0, ΔS0 and ΔCP) in the 
SI, and provide a table of heat capacities (SI Table 4).
Mutations N30A, T29G, I28N/T29G, S32s and W11F had ΦT values > 0.7 (Fig. 3, dotted 
horizontal line), which we chose as a reasonable cut-off for distinguishing between 
conservative and perturbing mutants because the ΦM values of mutants W11F, T29G and 
I28N/T29G either stand-out as clear outliers or are not cross-validated by other mutants (Fig. 
2B). In these mutants, the transition state shifts closer to the native state such that their ΦM 
values are no longer reliable indicators of the unperturbed “wild type” transition state 
ensemble, and thus must be excluded from consensus ΦM analysis. Excluding the 
abovementioned 5 outliers, the remaining mutants fall within a 25 % interval around the 
average ΦT value of 0.50 (Fig. 3, horizontal dashed line). Loop 2 mutants in general tend to 
have higher ΦT values, indicative that loop 2 can compete with loop 1 for becoming rate-
limiting at higher temperatures.
The ±0.2 spread in the transition state locations as quantified by ΦT is similar to that 
reported for the FBP28 WW domain, analyzed using Tanford’s βT value [32]. Even though 
the individual ΦT values were measured with high precision (error in ΦT ~ 0.02), the 
systematic error in ΦT may be substantially larger. This is best seen when we compare the 
ΦT values of multiple mutations for one residue. Mutants R21A and R21H have very similar 
ΦM values (0.95 and 0.89) and essentially identical ΦT values (0.44 and 0.45), while mutants 
R14A, R14L and R14F also have similar ΦM values, but their ΦT values that span 25 %.
The most dramatic shift in ΦT is found for the I28N/T29G mutant, whose large ΦM value 
(0.96 ± 0.02) also poorly agrees with other loop 2 mutants (Fig. 2B, Table 1). The double 
mutation I28N/R29G replaces the central two residues of loop 2 with a sequence that has a 
strong propensity to fold into a tight type-I’ turn, suggesting that loop 2 is particularly prone 
to mutations that introduce residues that have a low propensity to adopt the helical αR-αR-
αR-αL backbone conformation that is required to form loop 2. Indeed, the statistically 
preferred residues at position 29 are Ser and Thr, and at position 30, Arg, Lys, Gly or Asn. 
Glycines (position 29) and alanines (position 30) are rare, or not found at all among WW 
domains.
For mutant W11F, the shift in ΦT is accompanied by a very large ΦM value that clearly 
stands out as a outlier from the mutant pool (Fig. 2A), while the perturbing effect (shift in 
ΦT) seen for loop 2 mutants T29G, I28N/T29G, N30A and S32s results in more subtle 
abnormalities in ΦM that are more difficult to identify by merely looking at the context-
dependent ΦM values alone (SI Fig. 5). A third class of mutants (e.g. P8A, S16A, V22A and 
Y24W) shows clear outlier ΦM values, but normal ΦT values.
4. High-resolution mapping of the folding transition state of hPin1 WW
General features of the transition state—Our approach for mapping the folding 
transition state of hPin1 WW was to pick the most conservative mutant set with ΦM values 
that were not outliers, based on cross-validation by multiple mutations, sequence neighbors, 
and backbone hydrogen bond neighbors, and whose ΦT values indicate no excessive shift of 
the transition state. Thirty-nine mutants (34 side chain and 5 backbone hydrogen bond

variants) fulfill these criteria and form a consensus set for transition state analysis (Fig. 4A, 
Table 2). Except for S19G and I28V, all mutants had ΔΔGf > 2 kJ/mol, close to or above the 
empirical cutoff (> 2.50 kJ/mol) for reliable ΦM analysis [33], and except for mutants I28A 
and E35Q/A, statistical errors in ΦM were small.
Several residues (L7, E12, R14, R21, Y23, F25, I28, T29) in hPin1 WW were probed by 
more than one side chain mutation. For these residues, we can calculate more robust (and 
more representative) error-weighted average ΦM values from the side chain ΦM values of 
individual mutations (Table 2). Mapping the (error-weighted average) side chain ΦM values 
onto the Cα-backbone of the folded protein reveals that loop 1 (S16-R21) is substantially 
more structured in the transition state than loop 2 (H27-N30) and hydrophobic cluster 1 (Fig. 
4B).
The (error weighted) average side chain ΦM plot is a smooth function of sequence (Fig. 5A, 
solid red line), indicating that the formation of transition state structure is governed mainly 
by local interactions. Even without the outlier mutants S16A/T, a peak at loop 1 is obvious 
(see SI Fig. 5 for an extended plot, including outliers). While hydrophobic cluster 1 contacts 
(probed by L7V/A, G10 and Y24F) are essential for hPin1 WW stability, their contribution 
to the folding rate is small, and folding of hPin1 WW is rate-controlled by the loop 1 
substructure that contributes only slightly to thermodynamic stability. The high side chain 
ΦM value of the C-terminal E35, although corroborated by two mutants (E35A/Q), may not 
truly report on transition state structure. E35 is a charged residue and solvent-exposed in the 
folded protein. Except for mutant S16A, we find good agreement between the ΦM values of 
individual Ala mutants and the consensus average ΦM value (SI Fig. 5).
Correlation between native-state disorder and non-classical ΦM-values in loop 
1—Here we propose the hypothesis that φM values >1 in loop 1 (see section 2) are due to 
native-state backbone dynamics. An NMR-solution structure of the apo-form of the isolated 
WW domain implies that loop 1 is intrinsically dynamic [34] (SI Fig. 3), and this dynamic 
nature appears to be preserved in the high-resolution X-ray structure (1.35 Å) of hPin1 WW 
in the context of the full-length hPin1 rotamase (Fig. 5B). Except for M15A in β strand 1, all 
mutations that yield non-classical ΦM values > 1 mutate residues that map onto the 
intrinsically more disordered loop 1 region, and the concordance between the average 
consensus ΦM values (Fig. 5A) and the thermal B factors (a convenient measure for native-
state conformational disorder) (Fig. 5C) is striking. The reasonable correlation between the 
local disorder of a loop 1 residue and the magnitude of its ΦM value (Fig. 5D) suggests that 
the ΦM values in loop 1 are shifted upward further, from values near 1 that are indicative of 
the importance of loop 1 in the transition state, to even larger values indicative of native state 
disorder. A more disordered loop 1 may better accommodate mutations that change 
backbone and sidechain entropy or perturb backbone hydrogen bonds, and thus yields a 
lower ΔΔGf (and a higher ΦM value), if at the same time the transition state is more sensitive 
to such mutations because other robust structure (e.g. hydrophobic core 1) have not yet 
formed.
Correlation between side chain and backbone hydrogen bond ΦM values—
Hydrophobic cluster 2 (R14-Y23-F25) that stabilizes the N-terminal β-hairpin is loosely

formed in the transition state, making an average of 73 % of its native contacts in the 
transition state (R14 = 77 %, Y23 = 72 %, F25 = 69 %, each calculated from the error-
weighted average ΦM, Table 2). The ΦM value of mutant K13k that weakens the E12-F25 
backbone hydrogen bond (0.80 ± 0.02) agrees well with the side chain ΦM values of 
hydrophobic core 2 that protects the hydrogen bond from solvent in native hPin1 WW, 
suggesting that the E12-F25 backbone hydrogen bond and hydrophobic cluster 2 form 
cooperatively in the folding transition state.
To test whether this correlation between backbone hydrogen bond and side chain ΦM values 
generally holds for hPin1 WW, it is helpful to compare the backbone and side chain ΦM 
values at the level of individual residues. We thus assign the ΦM value of a perturbed 
backbone hydrogen bond to the two residues that form such a bond, not the residue that is 
mutated to perturb the hydrogen bond (as done in a previous study [16]). For example, 
mutation S16s eliminates the S16-R21 backbone hydrogen bond by replacing the amide 
moiety of the M15-S16 backbone peptide bond that acts as a hydrogen bond donor to form 
the backbone hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety of residue R21 with an ester moiety 
that cannot engage in backbone hydrogen bond formation (Fig. 1B). Here, we assign the ΦM 
of the S16s mutant to both residue S16 and R21. Likewise, mutation K13k perturbs, but does 
not eliminate, the backbone hydrogen bond between residues E12 and F25, by weakening 
the hydrogen bond acceptor (backbone carbonyl) of E12 (Fig. 1B). Here, however, it would 
be more correct to assign the ΦM of K13k not to residue K13 but to residues E12 and F25 
that form the backbone H, even though formally, the amide-moiety of residue K13 is 
mutated.
Overall, we find good agreement between the “residue-assigned” backbone ΦM values (Fig. 
5A, filled blue circles) and the ΦM values from classical side chain mutation (Fig. 5A, filled 
red circles), in particular within the hairpin 2 region (Table 2). As the strength of a hydrogen 
bond is strongly dependent on the distance between the hydrogen bond donor (backbone 
amide) and hydrogen bond acceptor (backbone carbonyl), even fractional backbone 
hydrogen bond ΦM values of ~0.5 imply that loop 2 is highly compact or that the measured 
fractional ΦM values within hairpin 2 represent ensemble averages with about 50 % of the 
molecules having hairpin 2 fully formed in the transition state ensemble (ΦM ~1), while in 
the other half of molecules hairpin 2 is disordered (ΦM ~ 0). Such a scenario has been 
predicted in less extreme form from Markov-State-modeling of hPin1 WW folding [35–37].
The poor agreement between the side chain and backbone ΦM values calculated for residue 
E12 probably stem from the removal of a solvent-exposed charged residue by mutations 
E12A/Q. Long-range electrostatic effects may play a role instead of just local contacts.
Variation of transition state structure with temperature—Probing the folding 
kinetics not just at a single temperature, but over a wider range of temperatures (here, 50, 55 
and 60 °C), reveals the robustness of the transition state ensemble against thermodynamic 
stress. Folding studies at various temperatures also identify ‘borderline’ mutations that 
perturb the folding mechanism under increased thermal stress, but whose disruptive nature 
might escape detection under more favorable folding conditions.

On average, the ΦM values increase by 0.07 units (Fig. 6A) and the ΦT value increases by 
0.15 units (Fig. 6B) upon raising the temperature from 50 to 60 °C (for data, see SI Table 1, 
Table 2). This suggests that the folding transition state becomes more structured and native-
like at higher temperature, and the transition state ensemble shifts along the reaction 
coordinate closer to the native state, in agreement with Hammond’s postulate [38].
A plot of ΦM(60°C)/ΦM(50°C) vs. sequence in Fig. 6C reveals that structure within hairpin 1 
(residues 12–25) at best changes only weakly with temperature. In contrast the loop 2 region 
(residues 27–30), the third β strand (residues 31–34) and hydrophobic core 1 (probed by 
L7A and L7V) increase by a larger margin and beyond experimental uncertainty. The 
absolute changes in ΦM are, however, rather small such that hairpin 1 still dominates 
transition state structure at higher temperatures. The Ala mutant W34A may show unusual 
temperature tuning (although it has a large error bar in Fig. 6C), and we speculate on a 
possible origin in the SI.
Average fraction of native contacts and its temperature dependence—For the 
set of consensus mutants depicted in Fig. 4A, we calculate an average ΦM value of 0.68 
± 0.04 at 55 °C, which is higher than the overall average ΦT value (0.50 at 55 °C, excluding 
the 5 outliers discussed in sections 3 and 4). Mutants with a higher slope of ΔG vs. T 
(folding cooperativity) have a higher melting temperature (Tm) (Fig. 7A, where ΔG=0 at 
T=Tm for all mutants). The average slope is +0.0017 kJ/mole/K, indicative of a negative 
folding entropy ΔS=−(∂ΔG/∂T), and increases by about 0.1 kJ/mole/K over the 35–60 °C 
range of melting temperatures. The size-dependence of ΔS for folding has been discussed in 
the literature [39, 40]. From the temperature dependence of the folding barrier on protein 
stability (Fig. 7B), we calculate a slope (∂ΔG†/∂T) ≈ 0.0024 kJ/mole/K (0.0028 for all 
mutants listed in Table 1). The ratio of the two slopes (activated/ground) is ~ 0.70 (0.63 for 
all mutants listed in Table 1). This value is also higher than the average ΦT value of 0.50, 
and suggests that there is a significant unfolding cooperativity effect in the folding transition 
state, although not as high as the unfolding cooperativity seen in the native protein. The ΦT 
value thus seems to slightly overestimate the distance of the transition state to the native 
state.
5. ΦM analysis of loop 1 insertion and deletion mutants
Mutant design and structural analysis—We recently designed and biophysically 
characterized several hPin 1 WW variants in which the wild type loop 1 sequence is replaced 
by either a 5-residue type-I G-bulge turn (the preferred loop type in WW domains) or 
tighter, 4-residue type-I’ turns that are not found among WW domains [7] (Fig. 8A).
The X-ray structures of the most stable type-I G-bulge variant (var1, or FiP, loop sequence: 
SADGR) and the most stable type-I’ turn variant (var3, loop sequence: SNGR) have been 
solved at 1.90 and 1.50 Å resolution, respectively. Both variants essentially superimpose 
with the wild type structure (1.35 Å resolution), except for the redesigned loop 1 region (Fig. 
8B). The thermal B factors of the FiP variant are consistently lower than that of wild type 
hPin 1 WW, while those of var3 are higher (SI Fig. 6). While the difference in the absolute 
values of the thermal B factors may result from different crystal packings, we note that turn

1 in the X-ray structure of FiP appears to be conformationally rigid, consistent with NMR-
solution data of the same turn in its natural FBP28 WW context (SI Fig.3). The 4-residue 
type-I’ turn of variant 3 shows a relative maximum in the B factor similar that of loop 1 in 
wild type hPin1 WW, suggesting that the type- I’ turn, although stabilizing and hastening 
hPin1 WW folding, is conformationally flexible in the folded protein.
Group ΦM analysis and ΦM vs. AAGf correlation—At 60 °C, and using wild type 
hPin1 WW as the reference protein, we calculate ΦM values of 0.92 ± 0.01 for FiP and 0.91 
± 0.01 for the related variant 2. Both ΦM values are cross-validated by the ΦM value of 
variant 2 calculated with FiP as “pseudo wild type” reference (0.94 ± 0.05) (Fig. 8D), 
demonstrating that ΦM analysis is surprisingly robust towards more severe sequence 
manipulations that simultaneously alter sequence and local chain topology. The ΦM values 
of FiP and related variant 2 also agree well with the ΦM values of mutants R21A, R21H and 
S16s (ΦM = 0.83–0.97) measured in the wild type loop context (Fig. 8C, D). This correlation 
is remarkable in that the mutants differ by up to 15 kJ/mole in stability. It further implies that 
in the strictly sequential folding model (loop 1 first, then loop 2) proposed for FiP by Shaw 
et al., the energy barrier of the second transition (loop 2 nucleation) must be sufficiently 
small for FiP-variant 2 to yield a ΦM value = 0.94 ± 0.05 (SI Fig. 7A). The GTT variant of 
FiP with an optimized loop 2 structure, however, significantly accelerates FiP folding (by a 
factor of three), suggesting that loop 2 formation in FiP is associated with a non-negligible 
barrier and rate-limiting for folding (SI Fig. 7B). Both observations are contradictory and 
difficult to reconcile in the framework of a sequential model, but perfectly compatible with a 
simple two-state mechanism, as in the latter case, stabilizing loop 1 and loop 2 mutations 
may additively lower the (single) transition barrier (SI Fig. 7C).
Type-I’ turn variants also hasten wild type hPin1 WW folding, but by a smaller margin than 
in FiP. In contrast, the two Gly insertion variants 6 and 7 (both less stable than wild type) 
slow down folding, presumably because of an increased entropic penalty to form the longer 
7- or 8-residue loop 1 substructure. All four variants yield ΦM values greater than 1, similar 
in magnitude to the ΦM values of wild type mutants S16G, S18G, S18G/S19G and G20A 
(Fig. 8D). As for wild type hPin1 WW (Fig. 5), increased local backbone dynamics around 
the type-I’ turn may cause the already high ΦM values to fall outside the classical range.
Hypothetical hybrid ΦM-map of FiP and comparison with MD-simulations—ΦM 
values are determined experimentally as a ratio of logarithms of rates to logarithms of 
equilibrium constants. This can be simulated directly by computation (using long trajectories 
or multiple shorter trajectories with Markov analysis to obtain rate and equilibrium 
constants), or it can be done by examining structure near the transition state (which has a 
Pfold ≈1/2 folding probability) and comparing with native structure (based on native 
contacts). In principle, the kinetic/energetic method is the more direct comparison, but 
structural information may have smaller error bars than energy information, so there is a 
tradeoff between the two approaches. Extensive data sets such as those in the present paper 
should become amenable to both approaches in the next few years, to test the merits of the 
structural vs. energetic approach to simulated ΦM values in detail. Here we present a brief 
comparison of our results, adapted to the FiP modification (see loop mutants in Table 1 for

example) of WW domain, and comparing with ref. [14], which presents both structure-based 
(native side chain contacts) and energy based (long trajectory kinetics) ΦM values. In the 
case of [14], the difference between experiment and the two computational approaches still 
exceeds the difference between the computations, so it appears that force field errors 
currently still dominate over errors caused by the structural approximation.
We assume that replacing the wild type hPin1 WW loop with the FiP loop 1 sequence only 
affects the local loop 1 energetics. This assumption is justified by the smooth dependence of 
ΦM on sequence, and by the nearly superimposable loop 2 and hydrophobic core 1 
substructures of FiP and wild type hPin1 WW (Fig. 8B). A hypothetical “hybrid” ΦM-map 
can be rendered for the ultrafast-folding FiP variant by combining the loop 1 ΦM value of 
FiP variant 2 (0.94 ± 0.05, measured with FiP as the “pseudo wild type” reference) with the 
non-loop 1 ΦM values obtained with wild type hPin1 WW (Fig. 9, red symbols and solid red 
line).
For loop 1 and its immediate sequence neighbors, our putative “hybrid” ΦM map (60 °C) 
agrees well with the simulated ΦM map calculated at slightly higher temperature (75 °C) 
[14]. This reinforces our hypothesis (previous paragraph) that replacing loop 1 in wild type 
hPin1 WW with more stable sequences hastens folding without changing the folding 
mechanism - either loop type is substantially (or fully) formed in the folding transition state. 
The ΦM values within the loop 2 region, however, do not agree very well. Here, the 
experimental ΦM values clearly suggest more structure within hairpin 2 than the MD-
simulation [14]. As loop 2 slightly gains structure with temperature this discrepancy should 
be even more pronounced at 75 °C (the temperature used for MD-simulations).
Shaw et al. argue that the folding mechanism of FiP is a direct consequence of the difference 
in the thermal stability of the N- and C-terminal hairpins. Although the isolated hairpins fold 
about one order of magnitude faster than full-length FiP and at similar rates in simulations, 
hairpin 1 with the optimized loop 1 sequence is significantly more stable (25 % folded 
hairpin at equilibrium) than hairpin 2 (4 % folded hairpin at equilibrium), such that loop 1 
nucleation is expected to kinetically outperform loop 2 nucleation. Although plausible, this 
model does not take into account the aforementioned significant (approximately 3-fold) 
increase in the folding rate that is seen experimentally with the GTT-FiP variant.
In hPin1 WW with the unstable and intrinsically flexible 6-residue loop 1 sequence, isolated 
hairpin 1 is expected to be much less stable, perhaps even less stable than isolated hairpin 2. 
This would open up three possible folding scenarios:
With both hairpins being similarly unstable, folding could occur through parallel pathways 
nucleated by either loop substructure (scenario 1), as predicted from Markov-state-modeling 
of hPin1 WW folding. In this case, the experimentally measured ΦM values for the loop 1 
and loop 2 regions would directly describe the relative flux along either pathway. In the 
simplest, and most extreme case, the hairpin whose loop segment nucleates folding is fully 
formed in the transition state (ΦM ~ 1) while the other hairpin is completely unstructured 
(ΦM ~ 0). For loop 2, we find average ΦM values of ~ 0.60 at 60 °C. Therefore, if that

extreme model applied, one would expect ΦM values of only ~ 0.40 for loop 1, which is 
clearly not what we observe experimentally (average ΦM > 0.9 at 60 °C).
Alternatively, both loop substructures may fluctuate between an open and a closed state, 
although not necessarily a native-like state, however a native-like N-terminal hairpin is 
mandatory for barrier-limited folding into the native state (scenario 2). In this model, loop 1 
residues will by necessity yield the highest ΦM values, while the loop 2 ΦM values will be 
reporters about the equilibrium ratio of the open and closed hairpin 2 conformations before 
their interaction with the structured N-terminal hairpin occurs. As loop 2 formation could 
either occur before or after loop 1/hairpin 1 formation, hairpin 1 would “catalyze” the final 
transition of hairpin 2 from the closed to the native state. This folding model is unlikely for 
wild type hPin1 WW domain because an increase in temperature should shift the loop 2 
equilibrium towards the open (less structured) conformation, so the loop 2 ΦM should 
decrease with temperature, rather than (slightly) increase. It may, however, become a 
dominant mechanism in fast-folding WW domains such as FiP.
The most likely folding model for hPin1 WW thus remains a two-state folding mechanism, 
in which folding and docking of the hairpins occurs in a concerted fashion. The measured 
ΦM values would then imply that the N-terminal hairpin is mainly formed in the transition 
state, while the second hairpin and the hydrophobic core are in the process of being formed 
in the transition state. Two-state folding of not only wild type hPin1 WW, but also the FiP 
variant, would also better explain why certain FiP variants such as FiP-GTT with stabilizing 
mutations within loop 2 and β strand 3 speed up its folding despite high ΦM values near 
unity in the hairpin 1 turn region.
Conclusions
ΦM-value analysis can provide valuable information about the structure of folding transition 
states by correlating changes in mutationally induced stability and folding kinetics. In its 
simplest manifestation, ΦM-value analysis can be affected by probe perturbation of the 
folding mechanism, and by a trickle-down effect of mutations that lowers the structural 
resolution. Such trickle down effects can arise for instance from native state flexibility, or 
from solvent interactions that do not report on genuine structure per se.
Here we present a comprehensive ΦM-value analysis with horizontal (sequence), vertical 
(multiple mutations at a single site) and chemical depth (side chain and “residue-assigned” 
backbone hydrogen bond mutations) to identify reliable mutations that can act as probes of 
the folding mechanism. The “conservatism” of mutations with respect to the folding 
mechanism is ascertained by multiple side chain substitutions at the same site (L7, E12, 
R14, S16, Y23, Y24, F25, I28 and T29), verification of individual ΦM values by cross-β 
strand neighbors (M15 vs. V22, E12 vs. F25), residue assigned ΦM values from backbone 
hydrogen bond mutagenesis (e.g. S16A/G/T vs. S16s, N26D vs. H27h) or immediate 
sequence neighbors (R21-V22-Y23 series), and temperature tuning (outliers in ΦT).
For some residues (R14, T29), ΦM values calculated from non-conservative mutations agree 
well with ΦM values calculated from more conservative and structurally less perturbative

mutations, while other mutations yield ΦM values that primarily report on the energetics of 
polar or charged residues with solvent (e.g. Y23F, E12A/Q, E35A/Q). Another subclass of 
mutations that target the flexible loop 1 substructure of hPin1 WW (S16G, R17r, S19G, 
S18G/S19G, G20A) yield ΦM values that lie clearly outside the classical range (ΦM > 1). 
Based on the correlation with X-ray B factors, their high ΦM values result at least in part 
from increased local backbone dynamics in the native state.
Although Ala mutations overall appear to be reliable reporters of transition state structure, as 
often assumed in the literature, we also identify clear outliers (P8A, S16A and V22A). 
Another Ala-mutant (W34A) shows an unusual dependence on temperature tuning. Its ΦM 
value decreases with temperature, suggesting that the smaller Ala residue perturbs non-
native interactions that are stable at low temperature, yet nevertheless speed up folding.
Aside from obvious mutant outliers that can be easily identified by cross-validating their ΦM 
values with different mutants at the same sequence location, another subset of mutants 
perturb transition state structure and shift the transition state ensemble to a more native-like 
ensemble state, as evidenced by large ΦT values for such mutations. Four of the five mutants 
that shift the transition state position in Fig. 5 map to the loop 2 region or immediately 
flanking residues. Although not dominating transition state structure, the wild type sequence 
of loop 2 can be perturbed sufficiently to affect folding rates. The ease with which the 
folding mechanism of the hPin1 WW domain can be changed by what appears to be subtle 
sequence modifications or perturbations of intermolecular forces (e.g. weakening a single, 
partially solvent-exposed backbone hydrogen bond as in amide-to-ester mutant S32s) argues 
against two-state folding with a well-defined, robust and narrow transition state and suggests 
a more complex, multidimensional energy surface with additional local extrema waiting to 
become rate limiting for folding, as shown experimentally and computationally for the 
FBP28 WW domain [4, 41]. The hPin1 WW domain is thus an apparent two-state folder, but 
not by a wide margin.
Using a more expanded set of consensus mutants, a detailed map of the folding transition 
state was generated that now covers 76 % of the hPin1 sequence (previous coverage: 50 %). 
Many of our earlier findings are supported in the present study, but some interpretations 
need to be modified or revisited. Loop 2 and β strand 3, which define the C-terminal hairpin 
in folded hPin 1 WW, appear to be more structured in the transition state than thought 
previously, and the discrepancy in the backbone and side chain ΦM values within the loop 1 
substructure can now be attributed to local backbone disorder in the folded protein, rather 
than a genuine variation in backbone and side chain structure. In fact, by assigning backbone 
hydrogen bond to the two residues that constitute the bond, we found good agreement 
between the ΦM values measured by side chain and backbone hydrogen bond perturbation 
for most positions.
The mutants with a thermodynamically and kinetically optimized loop 1 substructure agree 
well with the native-like ΦM values of the highly destabilized loop 1 variants R21A/H and 
S16s mutants that perturb the 6-residue wild type hPin1 WW loop. Clearly, in both wild type 
hPin1 and the redesigned variants, the tip of the loop/turn is fully developed in the transition 
state. These observations and the fact that stabilizing loop 2 in the already fast folding FiP

domain further speeds up folding by a factor of 3 are difficult to reconcile in a truly 
sequential (framework) model for folding, making a simple two-state folding mechanism 
more likely. Alternatively, as suggested by some simulations [35, 42] and experiments [43] 
of fast-folding WW domains, loop 2 could actually form before or after loop 1, or fluctuate 
between folded and unfolded conformations before loop 1 forms, while loop 1 remains rate-
limiting due to its larger activation barrier. Additional experiments with mutations targeting 
loop 2 in FiP are needed to further discriminate between these alternatives.
Materials and Methods
Nomenclature
Residues of the hPin1 WW domain are abbreviated by a single capital letter, followed by the 
number of the residue in the sequence (e.g. W11). Amino acids are also abbreviated using 
the standard three letter code (e.g. Trp for tryptophan). Classical side chain mutants are 
indicated by single letter code (e.g. W11F), with the first and second letters representing the 
wild type and replacing residue, respectively, and the number indicates the sequence 
position. Non-classical backbone hydrogen bond mutations are also designated by single 
letter code. The first letter represents the mutated residue, and the same letter in small 
capitals is used for the replacing residue (e.g. S16s) to distinguish a non-classical amide-to-
ester mutation from their classical counterparts.
Protein expression and sample preparation
The wild type hPin1 WW domain and mutants thereof with classical side chain mutations 
were prepared recombinantly, as described in detail in another publication [10]. hPin1 WW 
variants with amide-to-ester mutations were synthesized chemically, as described in detail in 
[16]. Protein identity and purity was ascertained by electrospray mass spectrometry, SDS-
PAGE, and reversed-phase HPLC chromatography.
Experimental procedures
Equilibrium unfolding of hPin1 WW was monitored by far-UV spectroscopy at 229 nm as 
described in detail in [10]. Unfolding transitions were analyzed by using a two-state model, 
where the folding free energy ΔGf is expressed by a quadratic Taylor series approximation: 
ΔGf(T)=ΔGf (1)(Tm)ֹ(T-Tm)+ΔGf(2)(Tm)ֹ(T-Tm)(2). The two coefficients ΔGf (i)(Tm), i=1⋯2, 
represent the temperature-dependent free energy of folding, and Tm is the nominal midpoint 
of thermal denaturation (ΔGf(Tm) = 0). The inclusion of the quadratic term was necessary to 
fit the data of most mutants within experimental uncertainty. For selected mutants, the 
transition was also analyzed by expressing ΔGf(T) in terms of a constant heat capacity 
formula. As shown previously for the hYap65 WW domain, both procedures yield nearly 
identical results [31].
Laser temperature jumps around the protein’s melting temperature were measured for each 
mutant as described in detail elsewhere [44, 45]. Briefly, a 10 ns Nd:YAG pulse Raman-
shifted in H2 heated the sample solution by ~ 5–10 °C, inducing kinetic relaxation of the 
WW domain to the new thermal equilibrium. 285 nm UV pulses, spaced 1 ns apart from a 
frequency-tripled, mode-locked titanium:sapphire laser, excited tryptophan fluorescence in

the hPin1 WW domain. Fluorescence emission was digitized in 0.5 ns time steps by a 
miniature photomultiplier tube with a 0.9 ns full-width-half-maximum response time. The 
sequence of fluorescence decays f(t) was fitted within measurement uncertainty by the linear 
combination a1f1(t)+a2f2(t) of decays just before and 0.5 ms after the T-jump. The 
normalized fraction f(t)=a1/(a1+a2) from t≈2 µs to t=0.5 ms was fitted to a single 
exponential decay exp[−kobs t] where kobs=kf+ku. Thus the signal extraction and data 
analysis are consistently two-state.
The observed relaxation rate coefficient was combined with the equilibrium constant Keq to 
compute the forward reaction rate coefficient kf=kobsKeq/(1+Keq). kf was measured for 
several temperatures (typically around 10) below and above Tm, and ΔGf †(T) was 
determined as a function of temperature using the relationship kf=A†.exp(−ΔGf†( T)/RT) 
with the quadratic Taylor approximation ΔG†f(T)=ΔGf †(0)(Tm)+ΔGf †(1)(Tm)(T-Tm)
+ΔGf †(2)(Tm)(T-Tm)2, as well as expansions about the temperature of maximal stability 
(T0), or the Gibbs-Helmholtz formula (see SI). The three coefficients ΔGf †(i), i=0⋯2, 
represent the temperature-dependent activation barrier. The frequency of activation A† was 
fixed at 500 ns−1, near the lower end of estimates of the folding speed limit [1], and the two 
coefficients ΔGf †(1)(Tm) and ΔGf †(2)(Tm) also incorporate some effects of temperature-
dependent solvent friction. Because previous ΦM analyses utilized a faster ad hoc frequency 
of 50 ns−1, the ΦM values of published mutants are shifted by a small constant from the 
recalculated values of these mutants in this study. Least squares fitting was carried out using 
IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics). Protein visualization was rendered using Pymol and Weblab 
viewer software packages (Accelerys, San Diego) [46].

Highlights
• Folding kinetics of a comprehensive set of hPin1 WW mutants, spanning the 
whole sequence and multiple substitutions at many sites, has been studied.
• A very conservative phi value analysis, identifying and excluding disruptive 
mutations, has revealed the interplay between loops 1 and 2 in the transition 
state in unprecedented detail.
• Unusually large “non-classical” phi values are now explained by local native 
state disorder.
• This comprehensive experimental data set will be valuable for comparison with 
molecular dynamics simulation, and we begin by creating a hybrid Phi-value 
map for FiP WW domain for comparison with recent all-atom simulations.

Figure 1. hPin1 WW structure and native state interactions
(A) Structural cartoon of the hPin1 WW fold, highlighting the two hydrophobic clusters that 
protrude from either side of the three-stranded β sheet. The individual β strand are color 
coded blue, while the loop segments and the N- and C-terminal extensions are shown in 
grey. Side chain contacts that constitute the hydrophobic clusters are shown as van der Waals 
surfaces. (B) Cα-backbone representation of the three-stranded β sheet region (residues 
W11-W34), highlighting the ten backbone hydrogen bonds that connect the three β strands 
and stabilize the 3-stranded β sheet topology. Hydrogen bonds that were perturbed by amine-
to-ester mutations for ΦM analysis are labeled in red. Residues are labeled in single letter 
code and are numbered. (C) Quantitative analysis of a complete Ala-scan, replacing each of 
the 33 non-Alanine residues individually with Ala. Destabilizations calculated at 55 °C 
range from near zero to ~ 9 kJ/mole and are mapped onto the Cα-backbone structure of the 
folded protein. Four Ala-mutants (labeled black) were either completely or significantly 
unfolded, even at low temperature (4 °C). For these four mutants, ΔΔG must exceed 9 kJ/
mol, but no accurate thermodynamic data can be derived in aqueous buffer without invoking 
stabilizing co-solvents.

Figure 3. ΦT analysis at 55 °C
Plot of the ΦT value for wild type hPin1 WW and mutants thereof vs the change in free 
energy (ΔΔG, in kJ/mol) between wild type and mutant. ΦT values are calculated using the 
T0-fitting procedure (for details, see SI supporting text 1). ΦT values of side chain and 
backbone hydrogen bond mutants are color coded red and blue, respectively. Except the 
obvious five outliers (mutants W11F, T29G, I28N/T29G, N30A, S32s), the ΦT values are 
within a ± 25 % error margin of the average ΦT (0.50, dashed grey horizontal line). The 
outlier ΦT values (> 0.70, dotted grey line) are indicative of perturbing mutations that shift 
the transition state ensemble along the reaction coordinate closer to the native state.

Figure 4. Analysis of the folding transition state of the hPin1 WW domain
(A) ΦM values of the 34 single and double mutants (dark grey) and the 5 amide-to-ester 
backbone hydrogen bonds mutants (light grey) that qualify for ΦM analysis, and that were 
used for consensus ΦM mapping of the folding transition state. (B) ΦM map of the folding 
transition state, with ΦM values for 25 of the 34 residues (single letter representation) 
mapped onto the C-α backbone structure of the N-terminally truncated folded protein 
(residues 6–39). Left panel: residues W11-W34 that define the 3-stranded β sheet. Right 
panel: Residues L7-P37 that includes hydrophobic cluster 1 and the N- and C-terminal 
extensions. For clarity, ΦM values were grouped and color-coded (0 < ΦM < 0.30, blue; 0.3 < 
ΦM < 0.6, purple, 0.6 < ΦM < 0.90, pink; ΦM > 0.90, red). Residues for which classical 
hydrophobic deletion mutagenesis yields very high, or negative, ΦM values that are not 
supported by other mutations or structural context are color coded black. Residues for which 
no mutant suitable for ΦM analysis is available are color coded white. Backbone hydrogen 
bonds that were studied by amide-to-ester mutagenesis are indicated by arrows (same color 
code as for side chains). Data used to render the figure are provided in Tables 1 and 2.

(A) Plot of ΦM values vs. the hPin1 WW sequence used for transition state analysis. 
Individual side chain ΦM values are color coded red, while those calculated from backbone 
hydrogen bond mutants are color-coded blue. The solid red line represents the error-
weighted average trend of the side chain ΦM (see Table 2 for data). (B) Tube plot showing 
the distribution of thermal B factors from the X-ray crystal structure [47] along the backbone 
of hPin1 WW domain. (C) Plot of thermal B factors vs. the hPin1 WW sequence, showing a 
pronounced maximum in loop 1, and a smaller maximum in loop 2. (D) Correlation between 
ΦM values and thermal B factors for residues M15-R21 with increased local backbone 
disorder at 55 °C. Side chain (sc) loop 1 mutants are color coded red and backbone hydrogen 
bond mutants (hb) are color coded blue. The solid lines represent best fits of the 
experimental data.

Figure 6. Variation of transition state structure with temperature
(A) Plot of ΦM (60 °C) vs ΦM (50 °C). On average, ΦM values increase by 0.07 units when 
raising the temperature from 50 °C to 60 °C, suggesting that the transition state overall gains 
native structure upon heating. (B) Plot of ΦT (60 °C) vs ΦT (50 °C). On average, ΦT values 
increase by 0.15 units when raising the temperature from 50 °C to 60 °C, suggesting that the 
transition state becomes more native-like at elevated temperature, consistent with 
Hammond’s postulate. (C) Plot of the ΦM (60 °C)/ ΦM (50 °C)-ratio vs the residue number 
of the hPin1 WW sequence. Data from individual side chain mutants are color coded red. 
Data from individual backbone hydrogen bond mutants are color coded blue. The solid red 
line represents the error-weighted average side chain trend. For clarity, the side chain data of 
E12 (large errors, see Table 2) are not shown.

midpoint of unfolding (T = Tm). The ratio of the two slopes (activated/ground) of ~ 0.70 for 
the 39 consensus mutants (0.63 for the entire mutant set) suggests that about 70 % of the

native contacts are developed in the folding transition state, a value that agrees well with the 
average calculated from the ΦM data (Table 2), but that is higher than the average ΦT value 
(0.50). The loop 1 insertion and deletion variants that change local changes in backbone

the extrapolated fits of the mutants with the 6-residue wild type hPin1 WW loop 1.

Figure 9. Hypothetical “hybrid” ΦM map for the fast-folding FiP variant of hPin1 WW
Hypothetical side chain ΦM map (red circles and solid red line) for the fast folding FiP 
variant of hPin1 WW, rendered with side chain ΦM values of non-loop 1 mutants measured 
with wild type hPin1 WW as reference (see Fig. 3, SI Table 2 for details) and the side chain 
ΦM value for loop 1 FiP WW variant 2 (loop 1 sequence: SSSGR) measured with FiP as 
“pseudo wild type” reference (loop 1 sequence: SADGR). As two residues were replaced 
simultaneously in FiP variant 2 (A18S, D19S, see Fig. 8A), the ΦM value calculated for 
variant 2 (ΦM = 0.94 ± 0.05) was assigned to either mutated residue (labeled by asterisks) in 
FiP. For residues that are probed by multiple side chain mutations, the error-weighted 
average ΦM value is shown (see SI Table 2 for details). Experimentally measured backbone 
hydrogen bond ΦM values (filled yellow squares) are those measured for wild type hPin1 
WW and are assigned to the two residues that engage in the perturbed hydrogen bond (see SI 
Table 2 for details). The simulated side chain and backbone hydrogen bond ΦM values and 
associated errors are shown in green and blue, respectively and were rendered from Fig. 2E 
in [14]. Residue numbers correspond to the 33-residue FiP sequence and thus account for the 
shorter loop 1 substructure (deletion of Arg17 of wild type hPin1 WW).
