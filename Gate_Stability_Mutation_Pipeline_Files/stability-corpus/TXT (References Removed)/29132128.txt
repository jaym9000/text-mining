Oxidatively modified forms of proteins accumulate during aging. Oxidized protein conformers might act as
intermediates in the formation of amyloids in age-related disorders. However, it is not known whether this
amyloidogenic conversion requires an extensive protein oxidative damage or it can be promoted just by a dis-
crete, localized post-translational modification of certain residues. Here, we demonstrate that the irreversible
oxidation of a single free Cys suffices to severely perturb the folding energy landscape of a stable globular
protein, compromise its kinetic stability, and lead to the formation of amyloids under physiological conditions.
Experiments and simulations converge to indicate that this specific oxidation-promoted protein aggregation
requires only local unfolding. Indeed, a large scale analysis indicates that many cellular proteins are at risk of
undergoing this kind of deleterious transition; explaining how oxidative stress can impact cell proteostasis and
subsequently lead to the onset of pathological states.
1. Introduction
Protein misfolding and aggregation are linked to the onset of more
than 40 human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and prion diseases or amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), but also non-neurodegenerative pathologies like type II
diabetes, cardiomyopathies, cataracts or even certain types of cancer
[1,2].
Native state stability and folding cooperativity disfavour the ag-
gregation of globular proteins, because they prevent local or global
unfolding and the subsequent population of aggregation-prone inter-
mediates. This appears as a very successful evolutionary strategy to
avoid aggregation, since only a few globular proteins aggregate from
their native conformation under physiological conditions [3]. Accord-
ingly, conformational diseases where globular proteins are involved,
are often triggered by pathogenic mutations that destabilize the native
fold, thus facilitating subsequent aggregation [4,5]. Even conservative
mutations might shift the delicate equilibrium between the folded and
aggregation-prone states in the cell [6], because increased conforma-
tional fluctuations suffice to enable the aggregation reaction, without a
need for global unfolding [7].
During their biological lifetime, proteins are frequently subject of
irreversible non-enzymatic post-translational modifications (PTM) as-
sociated to molecular aging. Oxidation represents an important class of
non-enzymatic PTMs since cells produce significant levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [8], which can react with susceptible side chains,
inducing various chemical modifications. Similarly to mutations, these
modifications may cause misfolding and shift the conformational
equilibrium towards more aggregation-prone states. Indeed, oxidative
protein damage is being found associated with an increasing number of
diseases and with aging [9–11].
The thiol functional group of Cys is particularly sensitive to redox
conversion and the thiol group of cysteines can be oxidized to different
states. The thiol and disulfide forms are the most common, but deri-
vatives with a higher oxidation state such as sulfenic (RSOH), sulfinic
(RSO2H), and sulfonic (RSO3H) acid are being detected in a growing
number of proteins. Indeed, up to a 5% of cellular protein Cys occur in
the sulfinic or sulfonic acid form [12]. Sulfonic acid is the most highly
oxidized species of thiols and its formation is irreversible. We have still
little information on how site-specific cystein sulfonic acid (CySO3H)

formation may impact protein conformation. Here, we take advantage
of the single Cys residue in position 57 of the yeast URN1 FF domain to
gain molecular insights on the effect of such PTM in the folding and
aggregation landscapes of this model globular protein.
FF domains are small protein-protein interaction modules consisting
of∼50–70 residues and characterized by the presence of two conserved
Phe residues at their N- and C-termini [13]. This fold consists of three α-
helices arranged as an orthogonal bundle with a 310 helix in the loop
connecting the second and the third helices [14,15] (Fig. 1). FF do-
mains are involved in RNA splicing, signal transduction and transcrip-
tion processes [16,17], they are present in a variety of eukaryotic nu-
clear transcription and splicing factors, and their sequences are well
conserved from yeast to humans [13]. The folding and aggregation
landscapes of several of these domains, including the URNF1 FF do-
main, have been characterized in detail [18–21]. This provides a unique
opportunity to dissect the impact of selective post-translational Cys
oxidation on protein folding kinetics, thermodynamic stability and
aggregation propensity. Here, we integrate experimental and compu-
tational analyses to understand how these properties are affected in this
model protein as well as at the proteome level. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the irreversible oxidation of a single free Cys is able to
dramatically impact the folding and stability of a globular protein,
leading to its aggregation into amyloid-like structures under physiolo-
gical conditions. Moreover, the data suggest that a significant fraction
of cellular proteins are exposed to this particular risk.
2. Material and methods
2.1. URN1 FF cloning, expression and purification
FF domain of yeast URN1 protein corresponding to residues 212-
266 was cloned, expressed and purified as previously described [14].
The purity of the samples was checked by SDS-PAGE. Protein con-
centration was determined by UV absorption using an ε 280 nm value of
1.948 mg−1 mL cm−1. FF mutants were engineered by PCR with
QuikChangeII Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, by following the manu-
facturer instructions (Agilent Technologies). Unless otherwise noted, all
the experiments were carried out in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH
5.7.
2.2. FoldX modelling
URN1-FF mutant models were built using the BuildModel command
/ routine of the FoldX algorithm [22] (version 3b6) on top of the FF-WT
structure (PDB: 2JUC). The resultant structures were used to calculate
the effect of the mutation on protein stability (ΔΔG = ΔGmut - ΔGwt)
[23].
2.3. Sample oxidation
Oxidation of FF domains was attained by incubating 1 mg/mL
protein in presence of 5% v/v H2O2 solution for 12 h at 298 K. An
extensive water dialysis at 277 K was used to remove non-reacted H2O2
from the protein solution before lyophilization. The oxidation state of
the sample was analyzed on an UltrafleXtreme mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics) before or after triptic digestion (3 h at 37 °C). Free
Cys residues were alkylated by adding to the samples an excess of
75 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer,
pH=8. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room tem-
perature.
2.4. Circular dichroism, Trp intrinsic fluorescence and bis-ANS binding
Lyophilized proteins were dissolved at 20 μM in 50 mM sodium
acetate at pH 5.7, filtered through a 0.22 µm filter and immediately
analyzed. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded from 260 to 200 nm, at
0.2 nm intervals, 1 nm bandwidth and a scan speed of 100 nm/min in a
Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corporation, Japan) thermostated
at 298 K. Twenty accumulations were averaged for each spectrum. Trp
intrinsic fluorescence was analyzed at 298 K in a Jasco FP8200 spec-
trofluorometer (Jasco Corporation, Japan). Three averaged spectra
were accumulated using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and re-
cording the emission from 300 to 400 nm with slit widths of 5 nm. To
study the binding to 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′- binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid
(bis-ANS), protein solutions were prepared at 20 μM in presence of
10 μM bis-ANS and analyzed immediately. Three spectra were recorded
in a Jasco FP8200 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Corporation, Japan) using
an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission between 400 and
600 nm with slit widths of 5 nm.
2.5. Thermal and chemical denaturation
Protein samples were dissolved at 20 μM to study thermal stabilities
by far-UV CD and Trp intrinsic fluorescence intensity. The ellipticity at
222 nm was registered in a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco
Corporation, Japan) in a range from 273 to 363 K, each 0.1 K with
2 min of temperature equilibrium between measures. Trp intrinsic
fluorescence emission was recorded at 360 nm after excitation at

280 nm, using slit widths of 5 nm for both wavelengths in a Jasco
FP8200 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Corporation, Japan). The fluores-
cence emission was monitored each 0.5 K with 1 min of temperature
equilibrium between measures.
For chemical denaturation, samples were prepared at 20 μM in
presence of different concentrations of denaturant agent (0–9 M of
urea). The reaction was left to equilibrate for 20 h at room temperature
and analyzed by CD and Trp intrinsic fluorescence at 222 nm and 280/
360 nm (ex/em), respectively. The results were fitted to a two-state
transition curve where the signals of the folded and unfolded states are
dependent on the temperature/denaturant concentration using the
nonlinear least squares algorithm provided with Kaleidagraph (Synergy
Software).
2.6. NMR spectroscopy
Lyophilized proteins were prepared at 50 μM in 20 mM deuterated
sodium phosphate buffer and 130 mM NaCl, at pH 5.7, using a 9:1H2O/
D2O ratio. One-dimensional NMR spectra were accumulated at specific
temperatures on a Bruker AVANCE 600-MHz spectrometer using sol-
vent suppression WATERGATE techniques. The collected spectra were
processed and analyzed using the TopSpinv2.0 software packages from
(Bruker Biospin).
2.7. Folding and unfolding kinetics parameters
Folding and unfolding kinetics were followed by recording intrinsic
fluorescence changes upon transition at 298 K in a Bio-Logic SFM-3
stopped-flow instrument (Bio-Logic Science Instruments), employing an
excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a 320 nm emission cut-off filter.
The protein concentration was 20 μM in 50 mM sodium acetate at pH
5.7 with or without urea. All fluorescence traces fitted well to a single
exponential function, and kinetic parameters were derived to a two-
state folding model, using the Kaleidagraph version 4.0 (Synergy
Software), as previously described [18].
2.8. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
MD simulations were carried as described in the Supplementary
Material.
2.9. Aggregation kinetics
Lyophilized URN1-FF samples were prepared at 100 μM in sodium
acetate buffer at pH 5.7 in presence of 25 μM of Thioflavine T (Th-T).
After equilibrating during 5 min at 310 K, Th-T fluorescence intensity
was monitored during 60 min in a Jasco FP8200 spectrofluorometer
(Jasco Corporation, Japan) using the Th-T excitation and emission
wavelengths at 440 and 475 nm, respectively, with slit widths of 5 nm.
2.10. Structural analysis of protein aggregates
Lyophilized protein samples were prepared at 50 μM in sodium
acetate buffer at pH 5.7 and incubated at 310 K under agitation during
one week.
Aggregated samples were diluted to 10 μM in sodium acetate buffer
at pH 5.7 in presence of 25 μM of Th-T and analyzed in a Jasco FP8200
spectrofluorometer (Jasco Corporation, Japan). Three Th-T spectra
were accumulated exciting at 440 nm and acquiring fluorescence
emission between 460 and 600 nm with excitation and emission slit
widths of 5 nm. In Congo red (CR) binding assay, FF domain aggregates
were diluted to 10 μM in presence of 20 μM of CR and optical absorp-
tion spectra were recorded from 400 to 700 nm at 298 K. Each trace
was the average of 3 accumulated spectra in a Cary-400 UV/Vis spec-
trophotometer (Varian Inc.). Spectra of protein only and CR solution
were acquired to subtract protein scattering and dye contribution.
Aggregated FF domains solutions, diluted at 10 μM, were also
analyzed by far-UV CD and bis-ANS dye binding as described above.
2.11. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
Aggregated samples were diluted tenfold in water and 10 μL were
placed on carbon-coated copper grids during 5 min. The grids were then
washed with distilled water and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate
for 1 min. An HITACHI H-7000 transmission electron microscope op-
erating at an accelerating voltage of 75 kV was used to visualize fibrils.
3. Results
3.1. FF domain oxidation specifically converts Cys57 into a cysteine
sulfonic acid
To investigate whether the impact of oxidation on protein properties
is modulated by the native state stability, we used here two different FF
domains: the wild type domain (FF-WT) and an Arg18Ala mutant (FF-
R18A) (Fig. 1), which corresponds to a destabilized, yet natively folded
FF domain variant.
FF domains were incubated in the presence of H2O2 and their oxi-
dation state was analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). An increase of ≈
64 Da was observed for both oxidized proteins, suggesting the in-
corporation of 4 oxygen atoms (supplementary Fig. 1). Further tryptic
digestion coupled with MS analysis allowed the identification of two
specific oxidation sites at Met3 and Cys57 (supplementary Table 1). A
methionine sulfoxide (MSO) accounting for one extra oxygen atom and
a cysteine sulfonic acid (CySO3H) incorporating 3 new oxygen atoms
(≈ +48 Da) were detected in the oxidized states of both FF variants.
Upon iodoacetamide treatment, carboxyamidomethyl Cys (CAM≈
+57 Da) formation is observable only for peptides derived from non-
oxidized proteins, consistent with the presence of a free and accessible
Cys57 thiol group in their native structures (supplementary Table 1). In
contrast, the Cys57 sulfonic acid in the oxidized domains prevents the
alkylation reaction. Therefore, the H2O2-induced FF oxidation resulted
in the modification of only two residues. Cys57 is located in the α-helix
3, whereas Met3 is absent in the natural domain, placed in the dis-
ordered N-terminal tail and, according to the NMR solution structure
[14], not interacting with any other protein residue. Therefore, any
impact on the protein globular conformation due to oxidation can be
adscribed to CysSO3H formation at position 57.
3.2. Conformational characterization of oxidized FF domains
The conformational properties of non-oxidized (FF-WT and FF-
R18A) and oxidized proteins (FF-WT-OX and FF-R18A-OX) were stu-
died at 20 μM concentration, pH 5.7 at 298 K, by far-UV CD spectro-
scopy (Fig. 2A), Trp intrinsic fluorescence (Fig. 2B) and bis-ANS
binding (Fig. 2C). In these conditions the URNF1 FF domain exhibits
maximal stability and solubility [18]. The typical α-helical minima at
210 and 222 nm, together with a characteristic FF domain minimum at
230 nm, are observed in the CD spectra of both non-oxidized proteins.
The FF-WT-OX domain retains the native secondary structure spectrum.
In contrast, the FF-R18A-OX spectrum reveals a conversion towards a
largely disordered conformation, displaying a minimum at ≈ 205 nm
(Fig. 2A).
The FF domain has two Trp residues at position 27 and 56 and their
fluorescence is a sensitive probe of the FF domain native structure [18].
The FF-WT-OX Trp emission spectrum shows higher fluorescence in-
tensity compared with that of the FF-WT, but keeps the same emission
maximum, indicating a larger exposure of Trp residues in a native-like
environment (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence spectrum of FF-R18A-OX is
significantly red-shifted and displays a higher maximum than that of
the non-oxidized mutant, consistent with the observed changes in sec-
ondary structure and likely associated with the opening of the globular

568
structure and the concomitant exposure of hydrophobic regions, as
indicated by the high enhancement of bis-ANS fluorescence in its pre-
sence (Fig. 2C). The analysis of bis-ANS binding also confirms con-
formational changes occurring in FF-WT-OX, but they are much smaller
than in FF-R18A-OX. The one-dimensional NMR (1H-NMR) spectra of
the oxidized FF domains at 298 K shows, in both cases, an alteration of
the native signal dispersion and peak sharpness suggesting structural
rearrangements relative to the parental proteins (supplementary Fig. 2).
3.3. Impact of Cys57 oxidation on FF domain stability
Thermal unfolding of the FF domains was followed at pH 5.7 by far-
UV CD and Trp intrinsic fluorescence, monitoring the changes in molar
ellipticity and fluorescence emission at 222 and 360 nm, respectively
(Fig. 3). The thermal denaturation curves show a single cooperative
transition and the data could be fitted to a two-state unfolding model
for all analyzed FF domains except for FF -R18A- OX, due to its lower
thermostability.
The stability of both FF domains resulted considerably perturbed by
CySO3H formation (Fig. 3A and B), with a decrease in FF-WT-OX Tm of
≈ 20 K respect that of FF-WT, and a reduction>20 K in the case of the
R18A-OX-Tm relative to FF-R18A (supplementary Table 2). These data
were corroborated by thermal denaturation followed by H-NMR1. Re-
duction of the native signal dispersion is observed at lower tempera-
tures in oxidized than in non-oxidized species both for FF-WT and FF-
R18A (supplementary Fig. 2). In all cases the reaction was reversible.
The chemical unfolding of the FF domains was analyzed at pH 5.7
and 298 K. The urea denaturation curves at equilibrium were obtained
recording the changes in molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 3C) and Trp
intrinsic fluorescence at 360 nm (Fig. 3D) at increasing denaturant
concentrations. The thermodynamic values were calculated assuming a
two-state model according to the unfolding single cooperative transi-
tion shown by all FF domains (Table 1). The ΔGF-U of FF-WT-OX
measured by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy corresponds to ≈
1.5 kcal/mol with a [Urea]50% of ≈ 2 M, in contrast to the ≈ 5.0 kcal/
mol and [Urea]50% of ≈ 6 M exhibited by FF-WT. Reliable thermo-
dynamic values could not be approximated for FF-R18A-OX since it
unfolds at very low urea concentrations (< 1 M). In FF-WT, CySO3H
reduces ΔGF-U by ≈ 3.5 kcal/mol. Because FF-R18A ΔGF-U ≈ 3.5 kcal/
mol is not surprising that FF-R18A-OX is unstable even in the absence of
denaturant.
Overall, thermal and chemical denaturation data, indicate that both
oxidized domains are significantly destabilized relative to non-oxidized
FF forms and that the impact of oxidation on the protein conformation
depends on the initial stability of the native domain.
3.4. Dissecting the reasons behind oxidized FF domains destabilization
Whereas it is evident that the presence of a CySO3H at position 57
(supplementary Fig. 3A, B) impacts significantly the stability of FF
domains, it is not clear if this effect results from the generic loss of the
Cys57 residue or rather it is caused by the presence of the sulfonic acid
in this specific position. In order to discriminate between these two
possibilities, FF-WT Cys57 was mutated to both Ser and Asp. The
Cys57Ser mutant (FF-C57S) was designed to investigate selectively the
effect caused by the loss of the thiol group in the free Cys side chain
(supplementary Fig. 3A, C). In the Cys57Asp mutant (FF-C57D), the
aspartate is intended to act as a “cysteine sulfonic acid mimic”, emu-
lating the negative charge of the oxidized Cys side chain (supplemen-
tary Fig. 3B, D). The changes in thermodynamic stability promoted by
the mutations were predicted with the FoldX algorithm [22] (ΔΔGtotal
= ΔGwt - ΔGmut), rendering ΔΔG values of−0.46 and 5.29 kcal/mol for
the FF-C57S and FF-C57D mutants, respectively, thus anticipating that
the previously observed domain destabilization was likely caused by
the irreversible oxidation of Cys57 and not by the mere absence of its
thiol group.
The secondary and tertiary structure of FF-C57S and FF-C57D mu-
tants were analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy (supplementary
Fig. 4A), Trp intrinsic fluorescence (supplementary Fig. 4B) and bis-
ANS binding (supplementary Fig. 4C). The CD spectra of both FF mu-
tants correspond to that of an α-helical structure (supplementary
Fig. 4A). The increase in Trp intrinsic fluorescence emission recorded
for FF-C57D suggests a certain opening of the globular structure as in
the case of FF-WT-OX. In contrast, the FF-C57S Trp emission spectrum
resembles that of FF-WT (supplementary Fig. 4B). The fluorescence
emission of FF-C57D in the presence of bis-ANS confirms a certain ex-
posure of hydrophobic regions to solvent, as in the case of FF-WT-OX.
The FF-C57S mutant exhibits much lower bis-ANS binding, with a
fluorescence intensity closer to that of FF-WT (supplementary Fig. 4C).

fluorescence, at 298 K. Free bis-ANS emission spectrum is represented with a black line.

3.5. Thermal and chemical unfolding of FF Cys57 mutants
The thermal and chemical stability of FF Cys57 mutants was ana-
lyzed at pH 5.7. The resulting data were compared with the thermo-
dynamic data obtained for FF-WT and FF-WT-OX (Fig. 4). Thermal and
chemical denaturation were monitored by far-UV CD at 222 nm and by
Trp fluorescence emission at 360 nm, respectively. A single cooperative
transition that could be fitted to a two-state unfolding model was ob-
served for both mutants. The melting temperatures obtained by CD and
Trp intrinsic fluorescence are similar (Supplementary Table 3),
coinciding to indicate that FF-C57D displays a thermal stability (Tm =
324 K) close to that of FF-WT-OX (Tm = 321 K), while FF-C57S (Tm =
335 K) is more similar to the wild type domain (Tm = 342 K). An
analogous behaviour was observed in chemical unfolding, FF-C57D
displaying a ΔGF-U ≈ 2.5 kcal/mol and [Urea]50% ≈ 3.5 M, whereas FF-
C57S displays a ΔGF-U ≈ 4.5 kcal/mol and [Urea]50% ≈ 5.9 M
(Table 1). Thus, taken together, these data indicate a similar destabi-
lization and structural rearrangement for FF-C57D and FF-WT-OX,
whereas the FF-C57S mutant, despite being slightly destabilized re-
lative to FF-WT, is clearly more stable, in excellent agreement with the

Chemical equilibrium curves with urea were followed at 298 K by (C) far-UV CD at 222 nm and by (D) Trp intrinsic fluorescence at 360 nm.

computational predictions. The absence of Cys residues in the FF-C57S
mutant allowed us to test whether the oxidation of Met3 could play a
significant role in FF domains destabilization. Thermal denaturation of
oxidized FF-C57S (FF-C57S-OX) indicates that modification of Met3 has
a low impact on protein stability, since the its Tm is only 3 K lower than
that of the non modified FF-C57S domain (Supplementary Fig. 5A and B
and Supplementary Table 3).
3.6. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
We carried out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain an
atomistic description of the reasons behind FF-C57D destabilization.
We used an enhanced sampling approach based on metadynamics that
was demonstrated to be very accurate in describing the effects of point
mutations or post-translational modification on protein conformation
[24–26]. Metadynamics is a method that was developed to sample rare
conformational transitions or post-translational modification on pro-
teins and to estimate with high accuracy the associated free energy
changes while keeping an atomistic description of both the solvent and
the protein [27,28]. Metadynamics simulations were carried out with a
state-of-the-art force field (CHARMM22*) [29] in explicit solvent for
more than 400 ns, as well as extended up to 550 ns to ensure con-
vergence of the free energy profiles. We used as reaction coordinates
(collective variables) properties that account for the overall structures
of the FF domain, i.e: the radius of gyration and the helical content in
the three α-helices of the FF fold. In agreement with the experimental
data, the C57D mutation has destabilizing effects in the metadynamics
simulations. Indeed, it can be observed that the mutation induces the
appearance of minima with larger Rg population in the free energy
landscape of the protein (supplementary Fig. 6A), which also correlates
with the destabilization of helix 1 (supplementary Fig. 6B) and specially
helix 3, where Cys57 resides, (supplementary Fig. 6D), resulting in a
lower helical content. According to MD, these changes in local helicity
impact the solvent accessibility of the two Trp residues of the protein, in
good agreement with the spectroscopic data.
3.7. Folding and unfolding kinetics of URN1 FF domains
Folding and unfolding kinetics of FF-WT, and FF-WT-OX, FF-C57S
and FF-C57D domains, were followed by stopped-flow at pH 5.7 and
298 K under a wide range of denaturant conditions. For all domains, the
folding and unfolding fluorescence traces fit well to a single exponential
function. Chevron plots appear to be linear in the entire range of de-
naturant concentrations studied and fit well to a two-state model, in-
dicating the absence of detectable intermediates (Fig. 5).
The rate constants for folding (Kf) and unfolding (Ku) and their
dependence on the denaturant concentration (mf and mu) are shown in
Table 2.
The FF-C57S mutant shows a folding rate very similar to that of FF-
WT, displaying, however, a slightly faster unfolding rate. FF-WT-OX
and FF-C57D domains fold only ≈3 times slower than FF-WT but, both
domains unfold very fast, with 155 and 85 times faster unfolding rates
than FF-WT, respectively. Thus, FF-WT-OX and FF-C57D domains dis-
play significantly reduced kinetic stability -the free energy difference

between the native state and the unfolding transition state (Table 2 and
Fig. 5), relative to the natural domain.
φF-U values are used to map structures of protein-folding transition
states from changes in free energies of denaturation and activation on
mutation. A φF-U value near 0 suggests that the region surrounding the
mutation is unstructured in the transition state for folding, while a
value near 1 indicates that the local structure around the mutation in
the transition state closely resembles the structure in the native state.
The φF-U values of 0.17, 0.20 and 0.17 calculated for FF-WT-OX, FF-
C57D and FF-C57S mutants, respectively, suggest that Cys57 is located
in a region that is not significantly involved in the formation of the
protein folding nucleus.
3.8. Amyloid fibril formation by FF domains
The aggregation kinetics of FF domains at 100 μM concentration
were analyzed at pH 5.7 and 310 K following the changes over time in
the fluorescence of the amyloid staining dye Thioflavin T (Th-T)
binding (supplementary Fig. 7). We have shown that under these con-
ditions WT-FF does not experience any detectable aggregation [18]. FF-
WT-OX and FF-R18A-OX aggregation was very fast, displaying Th-T
binding immediately after mixing. A similar behaviour is exhibited by
the FF-C57D despite it required a longer time to attain the plateau. No
significative Th-T binding was observed for FF-WT, FF-R18A and FF-
C57S variants.
Thereafter, all FF domains were incubated at 50 μM concentration
pH 5.7 and 310 K under agitation for one week in order to characterize
the conformational, tinctorial and morphological properties of the ag-
gregates (Fig. 6). Mature aggregates of both oxidized FF domains
showed high Th-T binding. FF-WT did not show any significative Th-T
binding, whereas FF-R18A exhibited certain dye binding, rendering,
however, much lower fluorescence intensity than the oxidized FF do-
mains (Fig. 6A). As in the case of FF-WT, the FF C57S mutant did not
bind the amyloid dye. Conversely, FF-C57D induced high Th-T fluor-
escence (Fig. 6B). To confirm the nature of these aggregates we used
another amyloid staining dye, Congo red (CR). In aggreeement with the
Th-T binding data, the characteristic CR signal shift at ≈540 nm upon
amyloid binding was observed for oxidized FF samples, while no CR
binding was detected for FF-WT and FF-R18A solutions. FF-C57D bound
the CR dye, promoting the same spectral change that FF-WT-OX. As
expected, FF-C57S did not show CR binding. To assess whether ag-
gregation involved a transition of the native α-helical structure into β-

sheet enriched conformations, the secondary protein structure of in-
cubated solutions was monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The pre-
sence of β-sheet structure was confirmed for FF-WT-OX as indicated by
the typical minimum at ≈218 nm. FF-R18A OX also exhibited a CD
spectrum compatible with the presence of β-sheet structures. Non-oxi-
dized FF proteins displayed a α-helical native-like spectra. The FF-C57S
also retained the native secondary structure whereas FF-C57D spectrum
was dominated by a β-sheet component, resembling the FF-WT-OX
spectrum. The bis-ANS binding to exposed hydrophobic regions was
much higher in oxidized samples than in non-oxidized FF domains,
indicaticave of intermolecular clustering of hydrophobic residues in the
aggregated species. Again, FF-C57D displayed a bis-ANS binding very
similar to that of FF-WT-OX, while the FF-C57S resembled FF-WT.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was used to assess the mor-
phological properties of the aggregates (Fig. 6C). Both FF-WT-OX and
FF-C57D formed short amyloid-like fibrils, while FF-R18A-OX displayed
fibrillar structures combined with amorphous aggregates consistent
with its very fast aggregation kinetics. On the other hand, scarce
smaller size aggregates were detected for FF-R18A, while no re-
cognizable aggregates were observed for FF-WT and FF-C57S. Oxida-
tion of Met 3 in FF-C57S-OX had a negligible impact on aggregation as
measured by Th-T and CR binding (Supplementary Fig. 5C and 5D).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that, under close to phy-
siological conditions, irreversible oxidation of Cys57 promotes the
formation of FF domain amyloid-like aggregates, highlighting the po-
tential relevance of this type of PTM for in vivo proteostasis.
3.9. Large scale prediction of the effect of proteins free cysteines oxidation
The data reported above indicate that complete thiol oxidation to
sulfonic acid at the single Cys residue in the FF domain induces con-
formational and structural changes that lead to the destabilization and
aggregation of this small globular protein. This effect can be emulated
by replacing Cys with Asp, which acts as a CysSO3H mimic, while the
substitution by Ser, as expected, does not recapitulate the oxidation
impact. In attempt to understand if site-specific Cys irreversible oxi-
dation might represent a generic destabilization mechanism in natural
proteins we used a database of 969 non-homologous protein structures
containing Cys residues [30]. From the total 4136 Cys present in these
proteins, 1446 are forming disulfide bonds and 2690 are free. Inspec-
tion of the respective structures indicated that 1338 of the non-dis-
ulfide-bonded Cys were solvent exposed. We virtually mutated all these
residues into Asp or Ser residues using the FoldX algorithm [22] and
calculated the predicted stability for every of the 2676 resulting mu-
tants. The analysis revealed a clearly destabilizing effect of Asp muta-
tions, with ΔΔG median value of 2.28±0.10 kcal/mol (Fig. 7A). Cys to
Ser mutations were predicted to have a much lower impact on stability
with a ΔΔG median value of 0.92±0.06 (95% CI, p< 0.001 T-student
test). These results strongly suggest that the Cys oxidation destabilizing
effect reported here for the FF protein model could occur in a wide
number of physiologically relevant proteins. For example, the Cys to
Asp mutants of human β-interferon (IFN-β) [31], and the human
apoptosis regulator Bcl-xL [32] are predicted to be highly destabilized,
with ΔΔG values of 4.57 and 6.38 kcal/mol, respectively.

The sequence-based aggregation prediction algorithms
AGGRESCAN [33] and Zyggregator [34] were used to assess if Asp, and
by analogy CySO3H, might act creating new or stronger “hot spots” that
favours the aggregation in the oxidized FF domain. No significant
changes in the FF-C57S aggregation propensity were predicted, relative
to FF-WT (supplementary Table 4). In contrast with the experimental
data, a reduction of the aggregation propensity was predicted for the
FF-C57D mutant, thus confirming that CySO3H induced aggregation
owes to the impact this PTM exerts on the protein conformation. The
AGGRESCAN analysis of the 2676 mutants modelled with FoldX pre-
dicted similar aggregation propensities for both Asp and Ser variants
(Fig. 7B).
4. Discussion
Molecular aging, and particularly, the accumulation of oxidized
proteins, are associated to a wide number of diseases, such as ALS,
Alzheimer’s disease, respiratory distress syndrome, muscular dys-
trophy, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis and progeria [35]. Oxidation can
promote alterations in the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure
of proteins [36–39]. The destabilized conformers resulting from protein
oxidation might act as intermediates in the formation of amyloid as-
semblies in age-related disorders [40,41]. However, biophysical dis-
section of the contribution of individually modified amino acids to this
deleterious conformational conversion is usually hampered by the si-
multaneous oxidation of different protein residues at different struc-
tural locations under oxidative conditions.
The data in the present work illustrate how the irreversible oxida-
tion of a single Cys residue can cause dramatic changes in the folding
landscape and aggregation properties of a globular protein. These re-
sults are consistent with the recent observation that the selective S-
Glutathionylation of a Cys residue results in destabilization of titin
immunoglobulin (Ig) domains [42]. We also show that the CySO3H
destabilizing effect can be emulated by a Cys to Asp mutation. Contrary
to FF-C57S, FF-C57D displays conformational, stability and aggrega-
tional features resembling those of the oxidized wild type protein, thus
indicating that the main destabilizing effect comes from the acquisition
of an additional negative charge and two bulky oxygens and not from
the lack of the original free thiol, which is consistent with CySO3H
being exclusively in a deprotonated form at physiological pH (pKa<
2). A similar impact on protein structure is expected for a milder Cys
oxidation to a sulfinic acid (pKa ~ 2).
The use of MD simulations allowed us to study in atomistic detail
the effect of the Asp mutation on the structural stability of the FF
domain. In good agreement with the observed experimental decrease in
stability, MD results indicate that the C57D mutation induces a sig-
nificant local destabilization, affecting helix 1 and helix 3. We have
previously shown that these helices comprise the most aggregation-
prone regions in the FF domain, being able to lead its aggregation under
destabilizing acidic conditions [18].
We were able to analyse, for the first time, the impact of CySO3H
formation on the folding and unfolding rates of a globular protein, re-
vealing that the conformational changes imposed by the sulfonic group
do not affect significantly the folding rate. Accordingly, the φ values
calculated for the oxidized FF protein and its two mutational variants
are very close to 0, indicating that the C-terminal region does not
present a native-like structure in the transition state for folding, as
described for the homologous human HYPA/FBP11 FF domain [19].
The unfolding rate, however, is dramatically accelerated by the for-
mation of the CySO3H or by the presence of the Asp residue. Thus, this
site-specific PTM acts by significantly reducing the kinetic stability of
the protein. Kinetic stability can be thought of as the average lifespan of
a folded molecule between transient excursions to an unfolded state;
thus, its reduction in the FF domain would allow for the transitory
exposition of the aggregation-prone helices to the solvent.
The destabilization of the native state is a usual requirement for
amyloid fibril formation in globular proteins [43]. Increasing evidences
indicate that there may be a link between ROS-induced oxidative stress
and the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the form of aggregates
[44]. In particular, recent works suggest that Cys oxidation to sulfonic
acid might be behind the aggregation of SOD1 in ALS or parkin in
Parkinson disease [45,46]. We show here that CySO3H induced protein
destabilization can promote the fast formation of amyloid-like insoluble
aggregates under physiological conditions, without a need for global
protein unfolding. Remarkably, our computational analysis suggests
that a large number of unrelated proteins containing exposed free Cys
residues are susceptible to suffer this deleterious conversion. Actually,
the FF domain is a highly soluble, remarkably stable and fast folding
protein. Despite all these properties confront aggregation, the oxidation
of a single Cys residue suffices to promote its aggregation into amyloid
fibrils. Many of the proteins in the cell do not exhibit these optimal
features and indeed, according to the ProTherm database [47], most
proteins would have stabilities< 3 kcal/mol and thus on the range of
the FF-R18A domain (3.5 kcal/mol), for which Cys57 oxidation suffices
to promote major conformational rearrangements leading to the rapid
build up of aggregates. Overall, our data suggest that when ROS levels
increase, as a result of aging or stress, cells might live on the edge of a
proteostasis catastrophe, even if proteins are not extensively oxidized.
